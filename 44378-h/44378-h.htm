<h2><br />KOHL IN DENMARK AND IN THE MARSHES.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Die Marschen und Inseln der Herzogthümer Schleswig und Holstein. Reisen in
Dänemark und den Herzogthümer Schleswig und Holstein.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Mr. Kohl, the most prolific of modern
German writers, the most indefatigable
of travellers, is already well
known to the English public by his
"Sketches of the English," "Travels
in Ireland," and many other publications
too numerous to remember. He
is a gentleman of marvellous facility
in travelling over foreign ground&mdash;of
extraordinary capabilities in the manufacturing
of books. Within five
years he has given to the world, hostages
for fame, some thirty or forty
volumes; and explored, socially, politically,
scientifically, and æsthetically,
North and South Russia, Poland,
Moravia, Hungary, Bavaria, Great
Britain, France, Denmark, and we
know not how many other countries
besides. It is as difficult to stop
his pen as his feet. He is always
trotting, and writing whilst he trots,
and evidently without the smallest
fatigue from either occupation. He
plays on earth the part assigned to
the lark above it by the poet: he,</p>

<p>
"Singing, still doth soar; and soaring, ever singeth."<br />
</p>

<p>He has already announced a scheme
that has occurred to him for a commercial
map, which shall contain, in
various colours, the productions and
raw materials of every country in the
world, with lines appended, marking
the course they take to their several
ports of embarkation. We shrewdly
suspect that this gigantic scheme has
grown out of another, more personal
and profitable, and already put in
practice. We could almost swear that
Mr Kohl had drawn up a literary map
on the very same principle, with dots
for the countries and districts to be
visited and worked up, and lines to
mark the course for the conveyance
of that very raw material, which he
is eternally digging up on the way,
in the shape of disquisitions about
nothing, and moral reflections on every
thing. Denmark occupies him to-day.
We will wager that he is already intent
upon working out an article or
book from neighbouring Norway or
adjacent Sweden.</p>

<p>It was remarked the other day by a
writer, that one great literary fault of
the present day is a desire to be "so
priggishly curt and epigrammatic,"
that almost every lucubration comes
from the furnace with a coating of
"small impertinence," perfectly intolerable
to the sober reader. If any
writer is anxious to correct this fault,
let him take our advice gratis, and
sit down at once to a course of Kohl.
So admirable a spinner of long yarns
from the smallest threads, never flourished.
We have most honestly and
perseveringly waded through his eleven
or twelve hundred pages of close print,
and we unhesitatingly confess that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
have never before perused so much, of
which we have retained so little. Does
not every man, woman, and child, in
these days of cheap fares and everlasting
steamers, know by heart all
that can be said or sung about "tones
from the sea?" Are they not to be
summoned, at any given moment,
under any given circumstances, by
your fire at twilight, on your pillow
at midnight? Mr Kohl proses
about these eternal "<i>tones</i>," till salt
water becomes odious&mdash;about
storms, till they calm you to sleep&mdash;about
calms, till they drive you to
fury&mdash;about winds and waves, till
your head aches with their motion.
We will not pretend to tell you,
reader, all the differences that exist
between high marsh-land and low
marsh-land, broad dikes and narrow
dikes, or to describe the downs and
embankments which we have seen, go
whithersoever we may, ever since we
have risen from the perusal of Mr
Kohl's book. We will not, because
Mr Kohl has dealt hardly by us, have
our revenge upon you. Nay, we could
not, if we would. The picture is
jumbled in our critical head, as it lies
confused in the author's work, which
is as disjointed a labour as ever
puzzled science seeking in chaos for a
system. Backwards and forwards he
goes&mdash;now up to his head in the
marshes, now lighting upon an island,
disdaining geography, giving the go-by
to history, dragging us recklessly
through digressions, repudiating any
thing like order, and utterly oblivious
of that beautiful scheme so dear to his
heart, by which we are to trace the
natural course of every thing under
the sun but the narrative of Mr Kohl's
very tedious adventures.</p>

<p>Mr Kohl knows very well what is
the duty of a faithful delineator of
foreign countries and manners. He
acknowledges in his preface, that his
work is rather a make-up of simple
remarks than a comprehensive description
of the countries named in
the titlepage. This confession is not&mdash;as
is often the case&mdash;a modest appreciation
of great merits, but a true
estimate of small achievements. It
is the simple fact. As for the consolatory
reflections of the author, that
he has at all events proved that he
knows more of the lands he describes
than his countrymen who stay at
home, it is of so lowly a character
that we are by no means disposed to
discuss it. When he adds, however,
that he has already earned a kind
reception from the world, and trusts
to be reckoned amongst the men who
have been useful, we may be permitted
to hint, that neither a kind
reception nor the quality of usefulness
will long be vouchsafed to the
individual who leads confiding but
unfortunate readers a Will-o'-the-Wisp
chase over bogs and moors that
have no end, and compels them to
swallow, diluted in bottles three, the
draught which might easily have
found its way into an ordinary phial.</p>

<p>That there are gems in the volumes
cannot be denied: that they are not
of the first water, is equally beyond a
doubt. Scattered over a prodigious
surface, they have not been gained
without some difficulty. Those who
are not able or disposed to turn to the
original, will be glad to learn from us
something of the sturdy Frieslanders
and Ditmarschers. They who have
energy and patience enough to overcome
the prolixity of the author, will
at least give us credit for some perseverance,
and appreciate the difficulties
of our task.</p>

<p>Mr Kohl commences his work with
a description of the <i>Islands</i>. We will
follow the order of the titlepage, and
begin with the "Marshes" and their
brave and hardy inhabitants. The
author informs us, with pardonable
exultation, that, upon asking a German
of ordinary education whether
he knew who the Ditmarschers are,
he was most satisfactorily answered,
"<i>Ja wohl!</i> are they not the famous
peasants of Denmark who would not
surrender to the king?" We question
whether many Englishmen, of
even an extraordinary education,
would have answered at once so glibly
or correctly. To enable them to meet
the question of any future Kohl with
promptness and success, we will introduce
them at once to this singular
race, and give a rapid sketch of their
country and political existence.</p>

<p>The territory inhabited by the Ditmarschers
is a small district of flat
country, stretching along the Elbe
and the Eyder, and is about a hundred
miles in length. Its maritime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
frontier was originally defended by
lofty mounds, which opposed the encroachments
of the sea; whilst inland
it found protection in an almost impenetrable
barrier of thick wood,
bogs, lakes, and morass. This barrier
constitutes the marshes so minutely
described by our author. The
Ditmarschers are a people of Friesic
origin; the name, according to Mr
Kohl, being derived from <i>Marsch</i>,
<i>Meeresland</i>, sea-land, and <i>Dith</i>, <i>Thit</i>,
or <i>Teut</i>, <i>Deutsch</i>, German. In the
time of Charlemagne, or his immediate
successors, the district was included
in the department of the Mouth
of the Elbe, and was known as the
Countship of Stade. It was bestowed
by the Emperor Henry IV., in 1602,
upon the archbishops of Bremen, to
be held by them in fief. The Ditmarschers,
however, were but slippery
subjects; and, maintaining an actual
independence within their embankments,
cared little who governed them,
provided sufficient advantages were
offered by the prince or prelate who
demanded their allegiance. In 1186,
we find them claiming the protection
of Bishop Valdemar of Sleswig,
the uncle and guardian of Prince
Valdemar, afterwards known as
Valdemar the conqueror; for, "being
grievously worried by the oppressions
of the bailiffs of their spiritual Lord,"
they declared a perfect indifference as
to "whether they paid tribute to
Saint Peter of Bremen, or Saint Peter
of Sleswig." They passed from the
rule of Bishop Valdemar, who was
subsequently excommunicated, to that
respectively of the Duke of Holstein,
the Bishop of Bremen, and Valdemar
II., King of Denmark. When the
last-named monarch gave battle to
his revolted subjects at Bornhöved
in Holstein, in the year 1227, the
Ditmarschers suddenly united their
bands with those of the enemy, and
decided the fate of the day against
the king. They then returned to the
rule of the bishops of Bremen, stipulating
for many rights and privileges,
which they enjoyed unmolested during
300 years; that is to say, up to the
year 1559, whilst they yielded little
more than a nominal obedience to
their spiritual lords, and evinced no
great alacrity in assisting them in
times of need.</p>

<p>During their long period of practical
independence and freedom, the
Ditmarschers governed themselves
like stanch republicans. Their grand
assembly was the <i>Meende</i>, to which all
citizens were eligible above the age of
eighteen. It met in extraordinary
cases at Meldorf, the capital: but
commonly seventy or eighty <i>Radgewere</i>,
or councillors, decided upon all
questions of national policy propounded
to them by the <i>Schlüter</i>, or
overseers of the various parishes into
which the district was divided, who
generally managed the affairs of their
own little municipality independently
of their neighbours. This simple institution
underwent some modifications
about the middle of the fifteenth
century, when, in consequence of
internal dissensions, eight-and-forty
men were chosen as supreme judges
for life. These "<i>achtundveertig</i>" had,
however, but little real power. They
met weekly; but on great emergencies
they summoned a general assembly,
amounting to about 1500 persons,
and consisting of the various councillors
and <i>schlüter</i>. This assembly held
forth in the market-place of the
capital. The masses closely watched
the proceedings, and when it was
deemed necessary, called upon one
of their own number to address the
meeting on behalf of the rest.</p>

<p>The peace enjoyed by the Ditmarschers
from without, contrasted
strongly with the tumults that were
often experienced within. The annals
of these people inform us, that
whole families and races were from
time to time swept away by the hand
of the foe, and by the violence of party
spirit. The Ditmarschers celebrate
several days as anniversaries of victories.
One, the <i>Hare</i> day, dates as
far back as 1288, when a party of
Holsteiners made an incursion into
the marshes, but were speedily opposed
by the natives. For a time the
two hostile bands watched each other,
neither willing to attack, when a hare
suddenly started up between them.
Some of the Ditmarschers, pursuing
the frightened animal, exclaimed <i>Löp,
löp!</i>&mdash;"Run, run!" The foremost
Holsteiners, seeing the enemy approaching
at full speed, were thrown
into confusion; whilst those behind
them, hearing the cry of "run, run!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
took to their heels, and a general rout
ensued. The day of "melting lead"
is another joyful anniversary. Gerard
VII. of Holstein, endeavouring in
1390<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to subjugate the country of the
Ditmarschen, drove the people at the
crisis of an assault to such extremities,
that they were obliged to take refuge
in a church, which they obstinately
defended against the Duke's troops,
until Gerard, infuriated, ordered the
leaden roof of the building to be
heated. The melted lead trickled
down on the heads of the Ditmarschers,
who, finding themselves reduced
to a choice of deaths, desperately
fought their way out, engaged the
Holsteiners, whom they overcame,
and who, ignorant of the country,
were either lost in the intricacies of
the marshes or drowned in the dikes.
The forces of a count, a duke, and a
king, were in turns routed by the
brave Ditmarschers, who have not
yet forgotten the glory of their ancient
peasantry. In 1559, however, they
ceased to gain victories for celebration.
In that year Denmark and the
Duchies united to subdue the small
but very valiant nation. They marshalled
an army of twenty-five
thousand picked men, whilst the
Ditmarschers could with difficulty
collect seven thousand. John Rantzan
commanded the allied army.
He captured Meldorf, set fire to
the town, pursued the inhabitants
in all directions and destroyed the
greater number whilst they were nobly
fighting for their liberties. Utterly
beaten, the Ditmarschers submitted to
their conquerors. Three of the clergy
proceeded to the enemy, bearing a
letter addressed to the princes as
"The Lords of Ditmarschen," and
offering to surrender their arms and
ammunitions, together with all the
trophies they had ever won. A general
capitulation followed: not wholly
to the disadvantage of the people,
since it was stipulated that none but
a native of the country should hold
immediate authority over it. At first
the land was divided amongst the
sovereigns of Denmark, Holstein, and
Sleswig; but in 1773 it was finally
ceded in full to the Danish monarch,
together with part of Holstein, by the
Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, (afterwards
Grand-Duke of Russia,) in
exchange for Oldenburg and Delmenhorst.
The Ditmarschers, at the present
hour enjoy many of their former
privileges: they acknowledge no distinctions
of rank; they have their
forty-eight Supreme Judges (the ancient
<i>schlüter</i>) under the name of
<i>Vögte</i> or overseers, and may, in fact,
be regarded as one of the best samples
of republicanism now existing in
the world.</p>

<p>Thus much for their history. Of
their far-farmed dikes and sluices, of
the marsh-lands and downs which
their embankments inclosed, much
more may be said, for Mr Kohl devotes
half his work to their consideration.
We will not fatigue the indulgent
reader by engaging him for a
survey. The land is distinguished by
the inhabitants by the terms <i>grest</i> and
<i>marsch</i>; the former being the hilly
district, the latter the deposits from
the sea:&mdash;the one is woody in parts,
having heath and sand, springs and
brooks: the other is flat, treeless,
heathless, with no sand or spring, but
one rich series of meadows, intersected
in every direction by canals and dikes.
Far as the eye can reach, it rests upon
broad and fertile meads covered with
grazing cattle; whilst from the teeming
plain stand forth farm-houses innumerable,
raised upon <i>wurten</i>, or
little hillocks, some ten or twelve feet
above the level of the land, for security
against constantly recurring inundation.
All external appliances
needful for the establishment are
elevated upon these heights, whose
sides are, for the most part, covered
with vegetable gardens, and here and
there with flowers and shrubs. The
houses have but one story; they are
long, and built of brick. For protection
against the unsteady soil, they are
often supported by large iron posts
projecting from the sides, and looking
like huge anchors. There are few
villages or hamlets in the marshes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
The inhabitants are not gregarious,
but prefer the independence of a perfectly
insulated abode. The "threshold
right" is still so strictly maintained
amongst them, that no officer
of police dare enter, unpermitted, the
house of a Ditmarscher, or arrest
him within his own doors.</p>

<p>The roads in the marshes, as may
be supposed, are, at times, almost
impassable; riding is therefore more
frequent than driving or walking,
although many of the more active
marshers accelerate their passage
across the fens by leaping-poles,
which they employ with wonderful
dexterity. The women ride always
behind the men, on a seat fastened to
the crupper. As the dikes lie higher
than the meadows, they prove the
driest road for carriages and passengers;
but they are not always open to
the traveller, lest too constant a
traffic should injure the foundations.
The carriages chiefly used are a species
of land canoe. They are called <i>Körwagen</i>,
and are long, narrow, and
awkward. On either side of the
vehicle, chairs or seats swing loosely.
No one chair is large enough for the
two who occupy it, and who sit with
their knees closely pressed against the
seat which is before them.</p>

<p>The process of gradually reclaiming
new land from the waves is somewhat
curious. As soon as a sufficient
amount of deposit has been thrown
up from the sea, outguards, or breakwaters,
called <i>höfter</i> are immediately
erected. Within the breakwater there
remains a pool of still water, which
by degrees fills up with a rich slime
or mud called <i>slick</i>. As soon as the
slick has attained an elevation sufficient
to be above the regular level of the
high waves, plants styled "<i>Queller</i>"
appear, and are soon succeeded by
others termed <i>Drücknieder</i>, from the
tendency of their interlaced roots and
tendrils to keep down the soft mud.
In the course of years, the soil rises,
and a meadow takes the place of
the former stagnant pool. As these
new lands are extremely productive,
often yielding three hundred-fold on
the first crop of rape-seed, sixty to
eighty fold on barley, and from thirty
to forty on wheat, their possession is
ever a subject of great dispute. Formerly
the diking and embankments
were undertaken by companies; but at
present they are in the hands of the
Danish government, which makes all
necessary outlay in the beginning, and
appropriates whatever surplus may remain
upon the original cost to future
repairs and to the aid of the general
poor fund. Some slight idea may be
formed of the enormous expense incurred
in the construction and maintenance
of these dikes, when we state
that the <i>Dagebieller</i> dike alone cost
ten thousand dollars for one recent
repair. Ninety thousand dollars
were one summer spent in
building embankments around reclaimed
land, now valued at one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, thus
showing a clear gain of sixty thousand
dollars by the undertaking. The embankments
are generally from fifteen
to twenty feet high. When the nature
of the soil upon which they are raised
is considered, together with the scarcity
of wood on these low lands, it
will not be difficult to understand
that constant labour is needed to
prevent the land from being undermined
by the sea, and that it is
only by unremitting industry, and constant
attention to the condition of the
breakwaters and dikes, that the enemy
can at all be kept at bay.</p>

<p>The dangers that are to be encountered,
and the laborious efforts that
must be made for subsistence at home,
train the Frieslander of the marshes
and islands for the perils of the deep,
which we find him encountering with
a brave and dogged resolution. The
islanders, especially, are constantly
engaged in the whale and other fisheries.
In the islands visited by Mr
Kohl, the greater number of the men
were far away on the seas, and their
wives and daughters conducting the
business of their several callings;
some tending cattle, some spinning,
others manufacturing gloves. Seals
abound upon the coast, and are caught
by sundry ingenious devices. A fisher
disguises himself in a seal-skin, and
travels up to a troop of these sea
monsters, imitating, as far as he is
able, their singular movements and
contortions. When, fairly amongst
them, he lifts the gun which has been
concealed beneath his body, and shoots
amongst the herd. If discovered
asleep a seal is sure to be caught, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
his slumbers are sound. Conscious
of his weakness, <i>Phoca</i> stations a
patrol at some little distance from his
couch, and an alarm is given as soon
as any man appears. At certain
seasons of the year vast flocks of
ducks light upon the islands, and are
caught chiefly by the aid of tame
decoy-birds, who mislead the others
into extensive nets spread for the
visitors. One duck-decoyer will catch
twenty thousand birds in the course
of a summer; the soft down obtained
from the breast of one species is the
<i>eider down</i>. The season begins in
September and lasts till Christmas.
Hamburg beef is due to the localities
we speak of. One of the large
meadow districts already mentioned,
is said to fatten eight thousand head
of oxen yearly, who, at their death,
bequeath to the world the far-famed
dainty.</p>

<p>The islands visited by our author
are those lying in that part of the
North Sea which the Danes call <i>Vesterhafet</i>,
or the western harbour, and
which extends close to the shores
from the mouth of the Elbe to Jutland.
Of these the most noted are
Syltoe, F&oelig;hr, Amrum, Rom&oelig;, and
Pelvorn. Around them lie many excellent
oyster-beds&mdash;royal property,
and yielding an annual income of
twenty thousand dollars. The people
inhabiting these islands are said to
be of Friesic origin: they certainly
were colonists from Holland, and they
still exhibit many peculiarities of the
ancient Friesic stock. They are clean,
neat, simple, honest, and moral. Few
establishments for the punishment of
culprits are to be found either in the
islands or on the marshes. As late
as the fifteenth and sixteenth century,
in cases of homicide the accused was
doomed to walk over twelve burning
ploughshares. Great crimes seem
unknown to-day; and the practice of
leaving house-doors unbarred and unlocked
upon the wide and desolate
marshes, testifies not a little to the
general honesty of the people.</p>

<p>Mr Kohl talks a whole boxfull of
balaam about the identity of the islanders
and the English. In the first
place, he insists that <i>Hengist</i> and <i>Horsa</i>
were gentlemen of Friesic extraction;
and secondly, he compares them
to a spirituous liquor: thirdly, he argues
on the topic like a musty German
bookworm, who has travelled no
further than round his own room, and
seen no more humanity than the grubby
specimen his looking-glass once a-week,
at shaving time, presents to him.
What authority has Mr Kohl for this
Friesic origin of Hengist and Horsa?
Is there a port along the Elbe and the
Weser, or on the coasts of Jutland
and Holstein, which does not claim
the honour of having sent the brothers
out? Is not the question as difficult to
decide, the fact as impossible to arrive
at, as Homer's birthplace? But supposing
the hypothesis of Mr Kohl to
be true, he surely cannot be serious
when he asserts, that the handful of
men who landed with the brothers in
Britain, have transmitted their Friesic
characteristics through every succeeding
age, and that these are discernible
now in all their pristine vigour and
integrity. Can he mean what he
says? Is he not joking when he puts
forward the "rum" argument? A
little of that liquor, he says, flavours
a bowl of punch. Why shouldn't a
little Friesic season the entire English
nation with the masculine force of the
old Teutonic Frieslanders? Why should
it? If Hengist and Horsa supplied the
rum, who, we are justified in asking,
came down with the sugar and lemon?
If the beverage be milk-punch, who
was the dairyman? These are questions
quite as apt as Mr Kohl's, not a
whit more curious than his illustrations.
The points of identity between
the Frieslander and the Englishman
are marvellous, if you can but see
them. The inhabitants of the marshes
and islands are grave, reserved, and
thoughtful; so are the English; so,
for that matter, are the Upper Lusatians,
if we are to believe Ernst Willkomm;
so are a good many other
people. The marshers have an eye to
their own interests; so have the English.
This is a feature quite peculiar
to the marshers and the English. It
may be called the <i>right</i> eye, every
other nation possessing only the left.
Of course, Mr Kohl is perfectly blind
to his interests, in publishing the present
work: yet he is Friesic too! From
the Frieslanders we have inherited our
"English spleen." How many years
have we been attributing it to the much
maligned climate? We are starched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
and stiff; so are the islanders. The
marshers dress a May king and queen
at a spring festival. We know something
about a May queen at the same
blessed season. If these were the
only instances of kindred resemblance,
our readers might fail to be convinced,
after all, of the truth of the Friesic
theory. These doubts, if any linger,
shall be removed at once. One morning
a Frieslander carefully opened
Mr Kohl's door, and said, "<i>I am
afraid</i> there is a house on fire." Kohl
rushed forth and found the building in
flames; which incident immediately
reminded him&mdash;he being a German
and a philosopher&mdash;of the excessive
caution of the Englishman, which,
under the most alarming circumstances,
forbids his saying any thing
stronger than "I believe," "I am
afraid," "I dare say." Verily we
"believe," we are "afraid," we "dare
say," that Mr. Kohl is a most incorrigible
twaddler. One more peculiarity
remains to be told. They keep gigs
in the marshes. There are "gentlemen"
there as well as in England.
Are there none elsewhere?</p>

<p>The customs of the Ditmarschers
could not fail to be interesting. That
of the <i>Fenstern</i> or <i>Windowing</i> is romantic,
and perilous to boot. At
dead of night, when all good people
are asleep, young gallants cross the
marshes and downs for miles to visit
the girls of their acquaintance, or it
may be <i>the</i> girl of fairest form and
most attractions. Arrived at the
house, they scale the walls, enter a
window, and drop into the chamber
of the lady, who lies muffled up to the
chin on a bed of down, having taken
care to leave a burning lamp on the
table, and fire in the stove, that her
nocturnal callers may have both light
and warmth. Upon the entrance of
her visitor, she politely asks him to be
seated&mdash;his chair being placed at the
distance of a few feet from the bed.
They converse, and the conversation
being brought to an end, the gallant
takes his departure either by the door
or window. Some opposition has been
shown of late to this custom by a few
over-scrupulous parents; but the
fathers who are bold enough to put
bolts on their doors or windows, are
certain of meeting with reprisals from
the gallants of the district. The <i>Fenstern</i>
is subject to certain laws and regulations,
by which those who practise
it are bound to abide. Another
curious custom, and derived like the
former from the heathen, was the
dance performed at the churching of
women up to the close of the last
century&mdash;the woman herself wearing a
green and a red stocking, and hopping
upon one leg to church. The Friesic
women are small and delicately formed:
their skin, beautifully soft and
white, is protected most carefully
against the rough atmosphere by a
mantle, which so completely covers
the face, that both in winter and summer
little can be seen beyond the eyes
of the women encountered in the open
streets. The generally sombre hue of
the garments renders this muffling the
more remarkable; for it is customary
for the relatives of those who are at
sea to wear mourning until the
return of the adventurers. Skirt,
boddice, apron, and kerchief, all are
dark; and the cloth which so
jealously screens the head and face
from the sun and storm, is of the
same melancholy hue.</p>

<p>The churchyards testify to the fact,
that a comparatively small number
of those who, year after year, proceed
on their perilous expeditions, return
to die at home. The monuments
almost exclusively record the names
of women&mdash;a blank being left for that
of the absent husband, father, or
brother, whose remains are possibly
mouldering in another hemisphere.
Every device and symbol sculptured
in the churchyard has reference to the
maritime life, with which they are all
so familiar. A ship at anchor, dismasted,
with broken tackle, is a
favourite image, whilst the inscription
quaintly corresponds with the sculptured
metaphor. It is usual for the
people to erect their monuments during
life, and to have the full inscriptions
written, leaving room only for the
<i>date</i> of the decease. In the island of
F&oelig;hr and elsewhere, the custom still
prevails of hiring women to make
loud lamentations over the body, as
it is carried homewards and deposited
in the earth. The churches are plain
to rudeness, and disfigured with the
most barbarous wood carvings of our
Saviour, of saints, and popes. These
rough buildings are, for the most part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[652]</a></span>
of great antiquity, and traditions tell
of their having been brought from
England. There can be no doubt
that British missionaries were here
in former days. At the time of the
Reformation, the islanders refused to
change their faith; but once converted
to Lutheranism, they have remained
stanch Protestants ever since, and
maintain a becoming veneration for
their pastors. The clergy are natives
of the islands, and therefore well
acquainted with the Friesic dialect,
in which they preach. Their pay is
necessarily small, and is mostly raised
by the voluntary contributions of the
parishioners. As may be supposed,
the clergy have much influence over
the people, especially on the smaller
islands, where the inhabitants have
but little intercourse with strangers.
Temperance societies have been established
by the pastors. Brandy, tea,
and coffee, came into general use
throughout the islands about a century
ago, and ardent drinking was in
vogue until the interference of the
clergy. The Ditmarschers especially,
who are allowed to distil without
paying excise duties, carried the vice
of drunkenness to excess; but they
are much improved.</p>

<p>The greatest diversity of languages,
or rather of dialects, exists in the
islands, arising probably from the
fact of Friesic not being a written
language. The dialect of the furthest
west approaches nearer to English
than any other. The people of <i>Amrum</i>
are proud of the similarity. They
retain the <i>th</i> of the old Icelandic, and
have a number of words in which the
resemblance of their ancient form of
speech to the old Anglo-Saxon English
is more apparent than in even the
Danish of the present day; as, for
instance, <i>Hu mani mile?</i> How many
miles? <i>Bradgrum</i>, bridegroom; <i>theenk</i>,
think, &amp;c. In many of the words
advanced by Mr Kohl, that gentleman
evidently betrays an unconsciousness
of their being synonymous with the
modern Danish; and, therefore, strikingly
inimical to his favourite theory
of the especial Friesic descent of the
English people and language. Little
or nothing is known of the actual
geographical propagation of the old
Friesic. At present it is yielding to
the Danish and the Low German in
the duchies of Sleswig and Holstein.
Many names are still common amongst
the people, which seem to have descended
from the heathen epoch, and
which are, in fact, more frequently
heard than the names in the "Roman
Calendar," met with elsewhere. <i>Des</i>,
<i>Edo</i>, <i>Haje</i>, <i>Pave</i>, <i>Tete</i>, are the names
of men; <i>Ehle</i>, <i>Tat</i>, <i>Mantje</i>, <i>Ode</i>, <i>Sieg</i>,
are those of women. None of them
are known amongst any other people.
Much confusion exists with respect to
the patronymic, there being no surnames
in use in many of the islands.
If a man were called <i>Tete</i>, his son
<i>Edo</i> would be <i>Edo Tetes</i>; and then,
again, <i>Tat</i>, the wife of the <i>Edo</i>, would
be <i>Tat Edos</i>, and his son <i>Des</i>, <i>Des
Edos</i>; whilst <i>Des's</i> son <i>Tete</i> would be
<i>Tete Des's</i>, and so on in the most
troublesome and perplexing combinations.</p>

<p>The Frieslanders, like other northern
nations, are superstitious, and they
have a multitude of traditions or sagas,
some of them very curious and interesting.
We must pass over these
instructive myths&mdash;always the rarest
and most striking portion of a people's
history&mdash;more cursorily than we could
wish, and cite a few only of the most
peculiar. The island of <i>Sylt</i>, which
is the richest in remains of <i>höogen</i>,
the celts of heathen heroes, &amp;c., lays
claim to the largest number of Märchen.
The most characteristic of all
is that of <i>de Mannigfuel</i>, the "colossal
ship," (or world,) which was so large
that the commander was obliged to
ride about the deck in order to give
his orders: the sailors that went aloft
as boys came down greyheaded, so
long a time having elapsed whilst
they were rigging the sails. Once,
when the ship was in great peril, and
the waters were running high, the
sailors, disheartened by their protracted
watching and labour, threw
out ballast in order to lighten the
vessel, when, lo! an island arose, and
then another, and another still, till
land was formed&mdash;the earth being,
according to the sailors' notion, the
secondary formation. Once&mdash;many
ages afterwards&mdash;when the <i>Mannigfuel</i>
was endeavouring to pass
through the Straits of Dover, the
captain ingeniously thought to have
the side of the vessel, nearest Dover,
rubbed with white soap, and hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
the whiteness of the cliffs at Dover.
The achievements recounted of <i>de
Mannigfuel</i> are endless. The following
explanation of the formation of the
Straits of Dover is found in a Friesic
saga:&mdash;Once upon a time, a queen
of England, the land to the west of
the North Sea, and a king of Denmark,
the land to the east of the
North Sea, loved each other, and
plighted troth; but, as it happened,
the king proved faithless, and left the
poor queen to wear the willow. England
was then joined to the Continent
by a chain of hills called <i>Höneden</i>;
and the queen, desiring to wreak vengeance
on her false wooer and his
subjects, summoned her people around
her, and setting them to work for
seven years in digging away these
hills, at the end of the seventh year
the waves pushed furiously through
the channel that had been dug, and
swept along the coasts of Friesland
and Jutland, drowning and carrying
away 100,000 persons. To this very
hour the Jutland shores yearly tremble
before the fatal vengeance of the
slighted queen. The Frieslanders are
so wedded to this marvellous geological
myth, that they insist upon its
historical foundation. In some versions
700, in others 7000, in others
again, even 700,000 men are said to
have been employed in this gigantic
undertaking.</p>

<p>Another allegorical saga is the narrative
of the share taken by the man
in the moon in the matter of the daily
ebbing and flowing of the sea. His
chief, or indeed only occupation,
seems to be to pour water from a
huge bucket. Being somewhat lazy,
the old gentleman soon grows weary
of the employment, and then he lies
down to rest. Of course whilst he
is napping, the water avails itself of
the opportunity to return to its ordinary
level.</p>

<p>The constellation of the Great Bear,
or Charles's Wain, is, according to
the Frieslanders, the chariot in which
Elias and many other great prophets
ascended into heaven. There being
now-a-days no individual sufficiently
pious for such a mode of transit,
it has been put aside, with other heavenly
curiosities, its only office being
to carry the angels in their nocturnal
excursions throughout the year. The
angel who acts as driver for the night,
fixes his eye steadily upon the centre
point of the heavenly arch, (the polar
star,) in order that the two stars of
the shaft of the chariot may keep in
a straight line with the celestial focus.
The rising and setting of the sun is
thus explained:&mdash;A host of beautiful
nymphs receive the sun beneath the
earth in the western hemisphere,
and cutting it into a thousand parts,
they make of it little air balloons,
which they sportively throw at the
heavenly youths, who keep guard at
the eastern horizon of the earth.
The gallant band, not to be outdone
by their fair antagonists, mount a
high ladder, and when night has veiled
the earth in darkness, toss back the
golden balls, which, careering rapidly
through the vault of heaven, fall in
glittering showers upon the heads of
the celestial virgins of the west. The
children of the sky, having thus diverted
themselves through the night,
they hasten at dawn of day to collect
the scattered balls, and joining them
into one huge mass, they bear it upon
their shoulders, mid singing and
dancing, to the eastern gates of heaven.
The enchanting rosy light which
hovers round the rising orb is the reflection
of the virgins' lovely forms,
who, beholding their charge safely
launched upon its course, retire, and
leave it, as we see it, to traverse the
sky alone.</p>

<p>The following exquisite tradition
connects itself with that brief season
when, in the summer of the far north,
the sun tarries night and day above
the horizon. <i>All-fader</i> had two faithful
servants, of the race of those who
enjoyed eternal youth, and when the
sun had done its first day's course,
he called to him <i>Demmarik</i>, and said,
"To thy watchful care, my daughter,
I confide the setting sun that I have
newly created; extinguish its light
carefully, and guard the precious
flame that no evil approach it." And
the next morning, when the sun was
again about to begin its course, he
said to his servant <i>Koite</i>, "My son,
to thy trusty hand I remit the charge
of kindling the light of the sun I have
created, and of leading it forth on its
way." Faithfully did the children
discharge the duties assigned to them.
In the winter they carefully guarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span>
the precious light, and laid it early
to rest, and awakened it to life again
only at a late hour; but, as the spring
and summer advanced, they suffered
the glorious flame to linger longer in
the vault of heaven, and to rejoice
the hearts of men by the brightness
of its aspect. At length the time arrived
when, in our northern world,
the sun enjoys but brief rest. It
must be up betimes in the morning
to awaken the flowers and fruit to
life and light, and it must cast its
glowing beams across the mantle of
night, and lose no time in idle slumber.
Then it was that <i>Demmarik</i>, for
the first time, met <i>Koite</i> face to face
as she stood upon the western edge
of heaven, and received from the
hands of her brother-servant the orb
of light. As the fading lamp passed
from one to the other, their eyes met,
and a gentle pressure of their hands
sent a thrill of holy love through their
hearts. No eye was there save that
of the <i>All-fader</i>, who called his servants
before him, and said, "Ye
have done well; and as recompense,
I permit ye to fulfil your respective
charges conjointly as man and wife."
Then, <i>Demmarik</i> and <i>Koite</i>, looking
at each other, replied&mdash;"No, All-fader!
disturb not our joy; let us
remain everlastingly in our present
bridal state; wedded joy cannot
equal what we feel now as betrothed!"
And the mighty <i>All-fader</i> granted
their prayer, and from that time
they have met but once in the year,
when, during four weeks, they greet
each other night after night; and
then, as the lamp passes from one to
the other, a pressure of the hand and
a kiss calls forth a rosy blush on the
fair cheek of <i>Demmarik</i> which sheds
its mantling glow over all the heavens,
<i>Koite's</i> heart the while thrilling
with purest joy. And should they
tarry too long, the gentle nightingales
of the <i>All-fader</i> have but to warble
<i>Laisk tudrück, laisk tudrück! öpik!</i>
"Giddy ones, giddy ones! take heed!"
to chide them forward on their duty.</p>

<p>With a lovelier vision, reader! we
could not leave you dwelling upon
the rugged but, to the heart's core,
thoroughly poetic Frieslander. Let
us leave the gentle Demmarik and
devoted Koite to their chaste and
heavenly mission, and with a bound
leap into Denmark, whither Mr Kohl,
in his forty-fourth volume of travels,
summons us, and whither we must
follow him, although the prosaic gentleman
is somewhat of the earth,
earthy, after the blessed imitations
we have had, reader&mdash;you and we&mdash;of
the eternal summer's day faintly embodied
in the vision of that long
bright day of the far north!</p>

<p>Should any adventurous youth sit
down to Mr Kohl's volume on
Denmark, and, half an hour afterwards,
throw the book in sheer disgust
and weariness out of the window,
swearing never to look into it
again, let him be advised to ring the
bell, and to request Mary to bring it
back again with the least possible
delay. Having received it from the
maid of all work's horny hand, let
the said youth begin the book again,
but, as he would a Hebrew Bible, at
the other end. He may take our
word for it there is good stuff there,
in spite of the twaddle that encountered
him erewhile at Hamburg.
Mr Kohl has been won by aldermanic
dinners in the chief city of the Hanseatic
League, as Louis Philippe was
touched by aldermanic eloquence and
wit in the chief city of the world, and
he babbles of mercantile operations
and commercial enterprise, until the
heart grows sick with fatigue, and is
only made happy by the regrets which
the author expresses&mdash;just one hour
after the right time&mdash;respecting his
inability to enlarge further upon the
fruitful and noble theme of the monetary
speculations of one of the richest
and most disagreeable communities of
Europe.</p>

<p>Before putting foot on Danish
ground, Mr Kohl is careful to make
a kind of solemn protest touching
Germanic patriotism, lest, we presume,
he should be suspected of taking
a heretical view of the question at
issue at the present moment between
the Sleswig-Holstein provinces and
the mother-country Denmark. It is
not for us to enter into any political
discussions here, concerning matters
of internal government which are no
more business of ours than of his Majesty
Muda Hassim, of the island of
Borneo; but we must confess our inability
to understand why such a terrific
storm of patriotic ardour has so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
suddenly burst forth in Germany, respecting
provinces which, until recently,
certainly up to the time when the
late king gave his people the unasked-for
boon of a constitution, were perfectly
happy and contented under the
Danish rule, to which they had been
accustomed some five or six hundred
years.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is only since the assembly
of the states was constituted, that the
Sleswig Holsteiners have been seized
with the Germanic <i>furor</i>&mdash;a malady
not a little increased by the inflammatory
harangues of needy demagogues,
and the pedantic outpourings
of a handful of professors stark-mad
on the subject of German liberty. If
there is one thing more absurd than
another, upon this globe of absurdity,
it is the cant of "nationality," "freedom,"
"fatherland," "brotherhood,"
&amp;c. &amp;c., which is dinned into your
ears from one end of Germany to the
other; but which, like all other cants,
is nothing but so much wind and
froth, utterly without reason, stamina,
or foundation. We should like to ask
any mustached and bearded youth
of Heidelberg or Bonn, at any one
sober moment of his existence, to
point out to us any single spot where
this boasted "nationality" is to be
seen and scanned. Will the red-capped,
long-haired <i>Bursch</i> tell us
when and where we may behold that
"vaterland" of which he is eternally
dreaming, singing, and drinking?
Why, is it not a fact that, to a Prussian,
an Austrian or a Swabian is an
alien? Does not a Saxe-Coburger, a
Hessian, and any other subject of any
small duchy or principality, insist,
in his intense hatred of Prussia, that
the Prussians are no Germans at all;
that they have interests of their own,
opposed to those of the true German
people; and that they are as distinct
as they are selfish? You cannot
travel over the various countries and
districts included under the name of
Germany, without learning the thorough
insulation of the component
parts. The fact is forced upon you
at every step. Mr Kohl himself belongs
to none of the states mentioned.
He is a native of Bremen&mdash;one of the
cities of that proud Hanseatic League
which certainly has never shown an
enlarged or patriotic spirit with reference
to this same universal "vaterland."
Arrogant and lordly republics
care little for abstractions. They have
a keen instinct for their own material
interests, but a small appreciation of
the glorious ideal. We ask, again,
where is this all pervading German
patriotism?</p>

<p>We have said that Mr Kohl is a
great traveller. We withdraw the
accusation. He has written forty odd
volumes, but they have been composed,
every one of them, in his snug
<i>stube</i>, at Bremen, or wheresoever else
he puts up, under the influence of
German stoves, German pipes, and
German beer. A great traveller is a
great catholic. His mind grows more
capacious, his heart more generous,
as he makes his pilgrimages along
this troubled earth, and learns the
mightiness of Heaven, the mutability
and smallness of things temporal.
Prejudice cannot stand up against the
knowledge that pours in upon him;
bigotry cannot exist in the wide
temple he explores. The wanderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
"feels himself new-born," as he learns,
with his eyes, the living history of
every new people, and compares, in
his judgment, the lessons of his ripe
manhood with the instruction imparted
in his confined and straitened youth.
If it may be said that to learn a new language
is to acquire a new mind, what
is it to become acquainted, intimately
and face to face, with a new people,
new institutions, new faiths, new habits
of thought and feeling? There
never existed a great traveller who,
at the end of his wanderings, did not
find himself, as if by magic, released
of all the rust of prejudice, vanity,
self-conceit, and pride, which a narrow
experience engenders, and a small
field of action so fatally heaps up.
We will venture to assert that there
is not a monkey now caged up in the
zoological gardens, who would not&mdash;if
permitted by the honourable Society&mdash;return
to his native woods a better
and a wiser beast for the one long
journey he has made. Should Mr
Kohl, we ask, behave worse than an
imprisoned monkey? We pardon M.
Michelet when he rants about <i>la belle
France</i>, because we know that the excited
gentleman&mdash;eloquent and scholarly
as he is&mdash;is reposing eternally in
Paris, under the <i>drapeau</i>, which fans
nothing but glory into his smiling and
complacent visage. When John Bull,
sitting in the parlour of the "Queen's
Head," smoking his clay and swallowing
his heavy, with Bob Yokel
from the country, manfully exclaims,
striking Bob heartily and
jollily on the shoulder, "D&mdash;n it, Bob,
an Englishman will whop three
Frenchmen any day!" we smile, but
we are not angry. We feel it is the
beer, and that, like the valiant Michelet,
the good man knows no better.
Send the two on their travels, and
talk to them when they come back.
Well, Mr Kohl has travelled, and has
come back; and he tells us, in the
year of grace 1846, that the crown-jewel
in the diadem of France is Alsace,
and that the Alsatians are the
pearls amongst her provincialists&mdash;the
Alsatians, be it understood, being
a German people, and, as far as report
goes, the heaviest and stupidest
that "vaterland" can claim. The
only true gems in the Autocrat's crown
are, according to the enlightened
Kohl, the German provinces of Liefland,
Esthonia, and Courland. All
the industry and enterprise of the
Belgians come simply from their Teutonic
blood; the treasures of the
Danish king must be looked for
in the German provinces of Sleswig
and Holstein. This is not all. German
literature and the German tongue
enjoy advantages possessed by no
other literature and language. English
universities are "Stockenglisch,"
downright English; the French are
quite Frenchy; the Spanish are solely
Spanish; but German schools have
taken root in every part of the earth.
At Dorpat, says Mr Kohl, German
is taught, written, and printed; and
therefore the German spirit is diffused
throughout all the Russias. At Kiel
the same process is going forward on
behalf of Scandinavia. The Slavonians,
the Italians, and Greeks, are
likewise submitting, <i>nolens volens</i>, to
the same irresistible influence. The
very same words may be found in M.
Michelet's book of "The People,"&mdash;only
for <i>German</i> spirit, read <i>French</i>.</p>

<p>Mr Kohl proceeds in the same easy
style to announce the rapid giving
way of the Danish language in Denmark
and the eager substitution of
his own. He asserts this in the teeth
of all those Danish writers who have
started up within the last fifty years,
and who have boldly and wisely discarded
the pernicious practice (originating
in the German character of the
reigning family) of expressing Danish
notions in a foreign tongue. He asserts
it in the teeth of Mrs Howitt
and of the German translators, whom
this lady calls to her aid, but who
have very feebly represented that rich
diction and flexible style so remarkable
in the Danish compositions referred
to, and so much surpassing the
power of any other northern tongue.
We should do Mr Kohl injustice if
we did not give his reason for regarding
the Danish language as a thing
doomed. He was credibly informed
that many fathers of families were in
the habit of promising rewards to their
children if they would converse in
German and not in Danish! Hear
this, Lord Palmerston! and if, on
hearing it, you still allow the rising
generation, at our seminaries, to ask
for <i>du pang</i> and <i>du bur</i>, and to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
them with, it may be, a silver
medal for proficiency, the consequences
be on your devoted head!</p>

<p>Denmark has been comparatively
but little visited by the stranger. She
offers, nevertheless, to the antiquary,
the poet, and the artist, materials of
interest which cannot be exceeded in
any other district of the same extent.
Every wood, lake, heath, and down,
is rich in historical legends or mythical
sagas; every copse and hill, every
cave and mound, has been peopled by
past superstition with the elf and the
sprite, the <i>ellefolk</i> and <i>nissen</i>. Her
history, blending with that of her
Scandinavian sisters, Norway and
Sweden, is romantic in the extreme&mdash;whether
she is traced to the days of
her fabulous sea-kings, or is read of
in the records of those who have
chronicled the lives of her sovereigns
in the middle ages. The country itself,
although flat, is picturesque,
being thickly interspersed with lakes,
skirted by, and embosomed in, luxuriant
beech woods; whilst ever and
anon the traveller lights upon some
ancient ruin of church or tower, palace
or hermitage, affecting, if only
by reason of the associations it awakens
with an age far more prosperous
than the present. The existence of
the Danish people, as a nation, has
been pronounced a miracle. It is
hardly less. Small and feeble, and
surrounded by the foreigner on every
side, Denmark has never been ruled
by a conqueror. Amid the rise and
fall of other states, she has maintained
her independence&mdash;now powerful and
victorious, now depressed and poor,
but never succumbing, never submitting
to the stranger's yoke. Her present
dynasty is the oldest reigning
European family. It dates back to
Christian I.&mdash;himself descended in a
direct female line from the old kings
of Scandinavia&mdash;who, as Duke of
Oldenburg, was chosen king by the
states in 1448.</p>

<p>A good account of Denmark and
the Danes is yet wanting. It may
be collected by any honest writer,
moderately conversant with the language
and history of the country. We
fear that Mr. Kohl will not supply the
literary void, if we are to judge from
the one volume before us. Others
are, however, to follow; and as our
author is immethodical, he may haply
return to make good imperfections,
and to fill up his hasty sketches.
We cannot but regret that he should
have passed so rapidly through the
Duchy of Holstein. Had he followed
the highways and byways of the
province, instead of flitting like a
swallow&mdash;to use his own words&mdash;over
the ground by means of the
newly-opened railroad through Kiel,
his "Travels" would surely have
been the better for his trouble. Instead
of pausing where the most volatile
would have been detained, our
author satisfies himself with simply
expressing his unfeigned regret at
being obliged to pursue his journey,
consoling his readers and himself with
the very paradoxical assertion that
we are most struck by the places of
which we see least; since, being all
of us more or less poetically disposed,
we permit the imagination to supply
the deficiencies of experience;&mdash;an argument
which, we need scarcely say,
if carried to its fullest limits, brings
us to the conviction, that he who
stays at home is best fitted to describe
the countries the furthest distant from
his fireside. Surely, Mr Kohl, you do
not speak from knowledge of the fact!</p>

<p>In his present volumes, Mr Kohl
refers only passingly to the subject of
education in Denmark. He remarks
that the national schools far surpassed
his expectations. He might have
said more. For the last thirty or
forty years, we believe, it has been
rare to meet with the commonest
peasant who could not read and write;
a fact proving, at least, that Denmark
is rather in advance than otherwise
of her richer neighbours in carrying
out the educational measures
which, of late years, have so largely
occupied the attention of the various
governments of Europe. No one in
Denmark can enter the army or navy
who has not previously received his
education at one or other of the military
academies of the country. The
course of study is well arranged. It
embraces, besides the classics, modern
languages, drawing, and exercises
both equestrian and gymnastic.
The academies themselves are under
the immediate direction of the best
military and naval officers in the service.
For the education of the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
two or three schools are provided
in every village, the masters receiving
a small salary, with a house and
certain perquisites. In 1822 the system
of Bell was introduced in the
elementary public schools, and since
that period it has been generally adhered
to.</p>

<p>Our author speaks with natural
surprise of the small number of Roman
Catholics he encountered in the Danish
States. The Papists have no church
or chapel throughout the kingdom;
indeed, with the exception of the private
chapel of the Austrian minister,
no place of worship. We were aware
that such was the fact a few years
ago; we were scarcely prepared to
find that Rome, who has been so
busy in planting new shoots of her
faith in every nook of the known
world, is still content to have no recognition
in Denmark. Heavy penalties
are incurred by all who secede to
the Romish church. In Sweden a
change to Roman Catholicism is followed
by banishment. This severity,
we presume, must be ascribed to state
policy rather than to a spirit of intolerance,
for Jews and Christians of
every denomination are permitted the
freest exercise of their faith. Since
the year 1521, the era of the Reformation
in Denmark, the religion of
the country has been Lutheran. The
Danish church is divided into five
dioceses, of which the bishop of
Zealand is the metropolitan. His
income is about a thousand a-year,
whilst that of the other prelates varies
from four to six hundred. The funds
of the clergy are derived principally
from tithes; but the parish ministers
receive part of their stipend in the
form of offerings at the three great
annual festivals. Until lately, there
existed much lukewarmness on all
religious questions. Within the last
ten or fifteen years, however, a new
impulse has been given to the spiritual
mind by the writing and preaching
of several Calvinistic ministers, who
have migrated from Switzerland and
established themselves in Copenhagen.
Their object has been to stop the recreations
which, until their arrival,
enlivened the Sabbath-day. They
have met with more success in the
higher classes than amongst the people,
who now, as formerly, assemble on the
green in front of the village church at
the close of service, and pursue their
several pastimes.</p>

<p>Mention is made in Mr Kohl's
volume, of the churchyards and cemetries
he visited in his hasty progress.
Compared with those of his
own northern Germany, the Scandinavian
places of burial are indeed
very beautiful. The government has
long since forbidden any new interments
to be made within the churches,
and many picturesque spots have, in
consequence, been converted into cemetries.
In the immediate vicinity
of Copenhagen there are several; but
the essence of Mr Kohl's plan being
want of arrangement, he makes no
mention of them for the present. One
of these cemetries, the <i>Assistenskirkegaard</i>,
outside the city, has an unusual
number of fine monuments, with no
exhibitions of that glaring want of
taste so frequently met with elsewhere.
The village churchyards are
bright, happy-looking spots, which,
by their cheerful aspect, seem to rob
the homes of the dead of all their
natural gloom and desolation. Every
peasant's grave is a bed of flowers,
planted, watched, and cherished by a
sorrowing friend. At either end of
the seven or eight feet of mound
rises a wooden cross, on which fresh
wreaths of flowers appear throughout
the summer, giving place only to the
"eternals" which adorn the grave
when snow mantles its surface. A
narrow walk, marked by a line of
box, incloses every mound; or, not
unfrequently, a trellis-work, tastefully
entwined of twigs and boughs. The
resting-places of the middle classes
are surmounted by a tablet, not, as
in our churchyards, rigidly inclosed
within impassable palisades, but
standing in a little garden, where
the fresh-blown flowers, the neatly
trimmed beds, and generally the garden-bench,
mark that the spot is
visited and tended by the friends of
those who sleep below. Hither
widowed mothers lead their children,
on the anniversary of their
father's death, to strew flowers on
his grave, to hang up the wreaths
which they have wound; but, above
all, to collect the choicest flowers that
have bloomed around him, which
must henceforth deck, until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
perish, the portrait of the departed,
or some relic dear for his sake. We
have watched the rough work-worn
peasant, leading by the hand his little
grandchild, laden with flowers and
green twigs to freshen the grave of a
long-absent helpmate; and as we
have remarked, we confess not without
emotion, feeble infancy and feeble
age uniting their weak efforts to preserve,
in cleanliness and beauty, the
one sacred patch of earth&mdash;we have
believed, undoubtingly, that whilst
customs such as these prevail, happiness
and morality must be the people's
lot; and that very fearful must
be the responsibility of those who
shall sow the first seeds of discord
and dissension amongst the simple
peasantry of so fair a land!</p>

<p>The cathedrals of Denmark are of
great antiquity. Those of Ribe, of
Viboig in Jutland, of Lard, Ringsted,
and Roeskilde, in Zealand, all date
from the end of the eleventh, or the
beginning of the twelfth century;
since which remote period, in fact,
no churches of any magnitude have
been erected. Roeskilde is one of the
oldest cities in the kingdom. In the
tenth century it was the capital. Canute
the Great may be considered as
the originator and founder of its existing
cathedral, which was completed
in the year 1054. It has occasionally
undergone slight repairs, but
never any material alteration. The
edifice is full of monuments of the
queens and kings of the ancient race
of Valdemar, as well as of those of
the present dynasty. Some of the
earliest sovereigns are inclosed within
the shafts of the pillars, or in the
walls themselves; a mode of sepulture,
it would appear, as honourable
as it is singular, since we find amongst
the immured the great <i>Svend Etridsen</i>,
and other renowned and pious
benefactors of the church. In front
of the altar is the simple sarcophagus
of Margaret, the great queen of
Scandinavia, erected by her successor,
Eric the Pomeranian. The
queen is represented lying at full
length, with her hands devoutly
folded on her breast. At this sarcophagus
our author lingers for a
moment to express sentiments which
would have brought down upon him
the anathemas of the good John
Knox, could that pious queen-hater
but have heard them. Mr Kohl defies
you to produce, from the number
of royal ladies who have held supreme
power in the world, one instance of
inadequacy and feebleness. Every
where, he insists, examples of female
nobility and strength of character are
found linked with the destinies of
kings who have earned for themselves
no better titles than those of the
<i>fainéant</i> and the simple. The style
of Roeskilde cathedral is pure Gothic;
but in consequence of the additions
which the <i>interior</i> has received
from time to time from kings and
prelates, that portion of the edifice is
more remarkable for historical interest
than for purity of style or architectural
beauty. One incident in
connexion with this building must
not be omitted. When Mr Kohl
quitted the cathedral, he offered his
cicerone a gratuity. The man respectfully
declined accepting even
the customary fees. The reason
being asked of a Danish gentleman,
the latter answered, that the man was
a patriot, and proud of the historical
monuments of his country; it would
be degradation to take reward from a
stranger who seemed so deeply interested
in them. One would almost
suspect that this honest fellow was <i>a
verger of Westminster Abbey</i>!</p>

<p>The church of St Kund, at Odense,
was erected in honour of King Kund,
murdered in the year 1100 in the
church of St Alben, at Odense. The
bones of the canonised were immured
in the wall over the altar. Many
sovereigns have been interred here.
Indeed, it is a singular fact that the
respective burial-places of every Christian
king of Denmark, from the earliest
times up to the present day, are
traced without the slightest difficulty;
whilst every heathen sovereign, of
whom any historical record remains,
lies buried beneath a mound within
sight of Seire, the old heathen capital
of the country. St Kund's church is
of Gothic architecture. Amongst the
many paintings that decorate its
walls is one of a female, known as
<i>Dandserinden</i>, or "The Dancer."
She is the heroine of a tradition, met
with under slightly modified forms
in various parts of Denmark. It is
to the following effect:&mdash;A young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
lady, of noble family, went accompanied
by her mother to a ball; and
being an indefatigable dancer, she declared
to her parent, who bade her
take rest, that she would not refuse
to dance even though a certain gentleman
himself should ask her as a
partner. The words were scarcely
uttered before a finely dressed youth
made his appearance, held out his
hand, and, with a profound obeisance,
said, "Fair maiden, let us not tarry."
The enthusiastic dancer accepted the
proffered hand, and in an instant was
with the moving throng. The music,
at that moment, seemed inspired by
some invisible power&mdash;the dancers
whiled round and round, on and on,
one after the other, whilst the standing
guests looked upon all with dread
horror. At length, the young lady
grew pale&mdash;blood gushed from her
mouth&mdash;she fell on the floor a corpse.
But her partner, (we need not say
who <i>he</i> was,) first with a ghastly
smile, then with a ringing laugh,
seized her in his arms, and vanished
with her through the floor. From
that time she has been doomed to
dance through the midnight hours,
until she can find a knight bold
enough to tread a measure with her.
Regarding the sequel, however, there
are a number of versions.</p>

<p>Mr Kohl's volume adverts cursorily
to the many institutions still existing
in Denmark, which owe their origin
to the days of Roman Catholicism,
and have been formed upon the model
of Catholic establishments. Several
<i>Frökenstifts</i>, or lay nunneries, are still
in being. They are either qualifications
of some ancient monastic foundation,
or they have been endowed
from time to time by royal or private
munificence. Each house has a lady
superior, who is either chosen by the
king or queen, or succeeds to the
office by right of birth&mdash;some noble
families having, in return for large
endowments, a perpetual advowson
for a daughter of the house. At these
<i>Frökenstifts</i>, none but ladies of noble
birth can obtain fellowships. As a
large number of such noble ladies are
far from wealthy, a comfortable home
and a moderate salary are no small
advantages. A constant residence
within the cloister is not incumbent
upon the "fellows;" but a requisition,
generally attached to each presentation,
obliges them to live in their <i>stift</i>
for a certain number of weeks annually.
The practice of founding
institutions for ladies of noble birth
has risen naturally in a country where
<i>family</i> is every thing, and wealth is
comparatively small: where it is esteemed
less degrading to live on royal
bounty than to enter upon an occupation
not derogatory to any but noble
blood. The system of <i>pensioning</i> in
Denmark is a barrier to real national
prosperity. Independence, self-respect,
every consideration is lost
sight of in the monstrous notion, that
it is beneath a high-born man to earn
his living by an honourable profession.
Diplomacy, the army, and navy, are
the three limited careers open to the
aristocracy of Denmark; and since
the country is poor, and the nobility,
in their pride, rarely or never enrich
themselves by plebeian alliances, it
follows, of course, that a whole host
of younger brothers, and a countless
array of married and unmarried patricians,
must fall back upon the bounty
of the sovereign, administered in one
shape or another. The Church and
Law are made over to the middle
classes. To such an extent is pride
of birth carried, that without a title
no one can be received at Court. In
order, therefore, to admit such as are
excluded by the want of hereditary
rank, honorary but the most absurd
titles are created. "<i>Glatsraad</i>,"
"<i>Conferenceraad</i>," Councillor of State,
Councillor of Conference, carry with
them no duties or responsibilities, but
they obtain for their possessors the
right of <i>entrée</i>, otherwise unattainable.
In Germany, the titles of the people,
from the under-turnpike-keeper's-assistant's
lady, up to the wife of the
lord with a hundred tails, are amusing
enough. They have been sufficiently
ridiculed by Kotzebue; but the distinctions
of Denmark go far beyond
them. A lady, whose husband holds
the rank of major (and upwards) in
the army, or of captain (and upwards)
in the navy, or is of noble birth, is
styled a <i>Frue</i>; her daughter is born a
<i>Fröken</i>: but the wife of a private
individual, with no blood worth the
naming in her veins, is simply <i>Madame</i>,
and her daughter's <i>Jomfrue</i>.
You might as easily pull down Gibraltar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
as the prejudice which maintains
those petty and frivolous distinctions.
It is highly diverting to witness the
painful distress of Mr Kohl at hearing
ladies of noble birth addressed as <i>Frue
Brahe</i>, <i>Frue Rosenkrands</i>, instead of
by the sublime title of <i>Gnädige Frau</i>,
eternally in the mouths of his own
title-loving countrymen. It is singular,
however, that whilst the Danes
are so tenacious of honorary appellations,
they are without those constant
quantities, the <i>von</i> and <i>de</i> of Germany
and France. The <i>Sture</i>, the <i>Axe</i>, the
<i>Trolle</i>, and the other nobles who, for
ages, lived like kings in Denmark,
were without a prefix to their names.
<i>Greve</i> and <i>Baron</i> are words of comparatively
modern introduction.</p>

<p>There are about twenty high fiefs
in Denmark&mdash;the title to hold one of
these lordships, which bring with them
many important privileges, being the
possession of a certain amount of land,
rated at the value of the corn it will
produce. The owners are exempt
from all payment of taxes, not only
on their fiefs, but on their other lands:
they have the supervision of officials
in the district: are exempted from
arrest or summons before an inferior
court, to which the lesser nobility are
liable; and they enjoy the right of
appropriating to their own use all
treasures found under the earth in
their lordships. Next to these come
the baronial fiefs; then the <i>stammehuser</i>,
or houses of noble stock, all
rated according to various measures
of corn as the supposed amount of
the land's produce; all other seats or
estates are called <i>Gaarde</i>, Courts, or
<i>Godser</i>, estates. The country residences
of the nobility are strikingly
elegant and tasteful. They are surrounded
by lawns and parks in
the English fashion, and often contain
large collections of paintings and
extensive libraries. Along the upper
corridors of the country residences of
the nobility are ranged large wooden
chests, (termed <i>Kister</i>,) containing the
household linen, kept in the most
scrupulous order. Many of these
<i>Kister</i> are extremely ancient, and
richly carved in oak. Every peasant
family, too, has its <i>Kiste</i>, which holds
the chief place in the sitting-room,
and is filled with all the treasure, as
well as all the linen, of the household.
Amongst other lordly structures, Mr
Kohl visited <i>Gysselfelt</i>,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> near Nestned
in Zealand. It was built in 1540 by
Peter Oxe, and still stands a perfect
representation of the fortresses of the
time. Its fosses yet surround it&mdash;the
drawbridges are unaltered: and, round
the roof, at equal distances, are the
solid stone pipes from which boiling
water or pitch has often been poured
upon the heads of the assailants below.
In the vicinity of this castle is
<i>Bregentned</i>, the princely residence of
the Counts <i>Moltke</i>. The <i>Moltke</i> are
esteemed the richest family in Denmark.
Their ancestors having munificently
endowed several lay nunneries,
the eldest daughter of the house is
born abbess-elect of the convent of
<i>Gysselfelt</i>: the eldest son is addressed
always as "His Excellence." The
splendid garden, the fine collection
of antiquities, the costly furniture and
appointments that distinguish the
abode at <i>Bregentned</i> send Mr Kohl
into ecstasies. He is equally charmed
by the sight of a few cottages actually
erected by the fair hands of
the noble daughters of the House of
Moltke. The truth is, Mr Kohl,
republican as he is, is unequal to the
sight of any thing connected with
nobility. The work of a noble hand,
the poor daub representing a royal individual,
throws him immediately into a
fever of excitement, and dooms his
reader to whole pages of the most
prosaic eloquence.</p>

<p>The condition of the peasantry of
Denmark is described as much better&mdash;as
indeed it is&mdash;than that of the
labourers of any other country. If
there is no superabundance of wealth
in Denmark, there is likewise no evidence
of abject poverty. The terms
upon which the peasants hold their
farms from the landed proprietors are
by no means heavy; and their houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[662]</a></span>
their manner of dressing, and their
merry-makings, of themselves certify
that their position is easy, and may
well bear a comparison with that of
their brethren of other countries.
Within the last twenty years, great
improvements have been effected in
agriculture, and the best English
machines are now in common use
amongst the labourers.</p>

<p>Upon the moral and political condition
of the Danish people at large,
we will postpone all reflections, until
the appearance of Mr Kohl's remaining
volumes. We take leave of volume
one, with the hope that the
sequel of the work will faithfully furnish
such interesting particulars as the
readers of Mr Kohl have a right to
demand, and he, if he be an intelligent
traveller, has it in his power to
supply. We do not say that this
first instalment is without interest.
It contains by far too much desultory
digression; it has more than
a sprinkling of German prosing and
egotism: but many of its pages may
be read with advantage and instruction.
If the work is ever translated,
the translator, if he hope to please

<h2>LORD METCALFE'S GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA.</h2>


<p>The death of Lord Metcalfe excited
one universal feeling&mdash;that
his country had lost a statesman
whom she regarded with the highest
admiration, and the warmest gratitude.
The <i>Times</i>, and the other public journals,
in expressing that feeling, could
only give a general and abridged memoir
of this great and good man.
Every part of his public life&mdash;and that
life commencing at an unusually early
period&mdash;stamps him with the reputation
of a statesman endowed in an
eminent degree with all the qualities
which would enable him to discharge
the most arduous and responsible
duties. Every part of it presents an
example, and abounds in materials,
from which public men may
derive lessons of the most practical
wisdom, and the soundest rules for
their political conduct. His whole
life should be portrayed by a faithful
biographer, who had an intimate
acquaintance with all the peculiar
circumstances which constituted the
critical, arduous, and responsible character
of the trusts committed to him,
and which called for the most active
exercise of the great qualities which
he possessed. That part of it which
was passed in administering the government
of Jamaica, is alone selected
for comment in the following pages. It
is a part, short indeed as to its space,
but of sufficient duration to have justly
entitled him, if he had distinguished
himself by no other public service, to
rank amongst the most eminent of
those, who have regarded their high
intellectual and moral endowments as
bestowed for the purpose of enabling
them to confer the greatest and most
enduring benefits on their country, and
who have actively and successfully
devoted those qualities to that noble
purpose.</p>

<p>No just estimate of the nature, extent,
and value of that service, and of
those endowments, can be formed,
without recalling the peculiar difficulties
with which Lord Metcalfe had to
contend, and which he so successfully
surmounted, in administering the
government of Jamaica.</p>

<p>The only part of colonial society
known in England, consisted of those
West Indian proprietors who were
resident here. They were highly educated&mdash;their
stations were elevated&mdash;their
wealth was great, attracting attention,
and sometimes offending, by
its display. It was a very prevalent
supposition, that they constituted the
whole of what was valuable, or
wealthy, or respectable in West Indian
colonial society; that those who were
resident in the colonies could have no
claim to either of these descriptions;
and that they were the mere hired
managers of the properties of the
West Indians resident in England.
This notion was entertained by the
government. The hospitable invitations
from the West Indians in England,
which a Governor on the eve of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
his departure for his colony accepted,
served to impress it strongly on his
mind. He proceeded to his government
with too low an estimate of the
character, attainments, respectability,
and property of those who composed
the community over whom he was to
preside. The nobleman or general
officer on whom the government had
been bestowed, entered on his administration,
familiar, indeed, with the Parliament
of Great Britain, and with
what Mr Burke calls "her imperial
character, and her imperial rights,"
but little acquainted with, and still
less disposed to recognise, the rights
and privileges of the Colonial Assemblies,
although those assemblies, in
the estimation of the same great authority,
so exceedingly resembled a
parliament in all their forms, functions,
and powers, that it was impossible
they should not imbibe some
idea of a similar authority. "Things
could not be otherwise," he adds; "and
English colonies must be had on those
terms, or not had at all." He could not,
as Mr Burke did, "look upon the imperial
rights of Great Britain, and the
privileges which the colonies ought to
enjoy under these rights, to be just
the most reconcilable things in the
world."</p>

<p>The colonists, whose Legislative Assemblies
had from the earliest period
of their history, in all which regarded
their internal legislation, exercised
the most valuable privileges of a representative
government, would, on
their part, feel that the preservation of
those privileges not only constituted
their security for the enjoyment of
their civil and political rights as Englishmen,
but must confer on them importance,
and procure them respect in
the estimation of the government of
the parent state. Thus, on the one
hand, a governor, in his zeal to maintain
the imperial rights, from the
jealousy with which he watched every
proceeding of the Assembly, and his
ignorance of their constitution and
privileges, not unfrequently either invaded
these privileges, or deemed an
assertion of them to be an infringement
of the rights of the Imperial Parliament.
On the other hand, the Colonists,
with no less jealousy, watched every
proceeding of the governor which
seemed to menace any invasion of the
privileges of their Assemblies, and
with no less zeal were prepared to
vindicate and maintain them. The
Governor and the Colonial Assembly
regarded each other with feelings
which not only prevented him from
justly appreciating the motives and
conduct of the resident colonists, but
confirmed, and even increased the unfavourable
impressions he had first
entertained. His official communications
enabled him to impart to and
induce the government to adopt the
same impressions. The influence of
these feelings, in like manner, on
Colonial Assemblies and colonists too
frequently prevented them from justly
appreciating the motives of the Governor,
from making some allowance for
his errors, and too readily brought
them into collision with him.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that those impressions
exercised on both sides of
the Atlantic an influence so strong, as
to betray itself in the communications
and recommendations, and indeed in the
whole policy of the government, as well
as in the legislation of the colonies.</p>

<p>This imperfect acquaintance with
the character of the resident colonists,
and the unfavourable impression with
which the proceedings and motives of
their Legislative Assemblies were regarded,
prevailed amongst the public
in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The colonial proprietors resident in
Great Britain felt little sympathy,
either with the colonial legislatures, or
with those resident in the colonies.
This want of sympathy may be attributed
to a peculiarity which distinguished
the planters of British from
those of other European colonies. The
latter considered the colony in which
they resided as their home. The former
regarded their residence in it
as temporary. They looked to the
parent state as their only home, and
all their acquisitions were made with
a view to enjoyment in that home. This
feeling accompanied them to England.
It was imbibed by their families and
their descendants. The colony, which
had been the source of their wealth
and rank, was not, as she ought to have
been, the object of their grateful affection.
They regarded with indifference
her institutions, her legislature,
her resident community. From this
want of sympathy, or from the want
of requisite information, they made no
effort to remove the unfavourable impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
with which the executive Government
and the Assemblies regarded
each other, or to promote the establishment
of their relations in mutual
conciliation and confidence.</p>

<p>Another cause operated very powerfully
in exciting a strong prejudice
against the inhabitants of our West
Indian colonies. The feeling which
was naturally entertained against the
slave trade and slave colonies was
transferred to the resident colonists,
and almost exclusively to them. By
a numerous and powerful party, slavery
had been contemplated in itself,
and in the relations and interests
which it had created, and its abolition
had been endeavoured to be effected
as if it were the crime of the
colonies <i>exclusively</i>. It was forgotten
"that it was," to use the language of
Lord Stowel, "in a peculiar manner the
crime of England, where it had been
instituted, fostered, and encouraged,
even to an excess which some of
the colonies in vain endeavoured to
restrain." Besides the acts passed by
the legislatures of Pennsylvania and
South Carolina, when those were British
colonies, we find that when the
Assembly of Jamaica, in 1765, was
passing an act to restrain the importation
of slaves into the colony, the
governor of Jamaica informed the
Assembly of that island, that, consistently
with his instructions, he could
not give his assent to a bill for that
purpose, which had then been read
twice. In 1774, the Jamaica Assembly
attempted to prevent the
further importation, by an increase
of duties thereon, and for this
purpose passed two acts. The merchants
of Bristol and Liverpool
petitioned against their allowance.
The Board of Trade made a report
against them. The agent of Jamaica
was heard against that report; but,
upon the recommendation of the Privy
Council, the acts were disallowed, and
the disallowance was accompanied by
an instruction to the governor, dated
28th February 1775, by which he was
prohibited, "upon pain of being removed
from his government," from
giving his assent to any act by which
the duties on the importation of
slaves should be augmented&mdash;"on the
ground," as the instruction states,
"that such duties were to the injury
and oppression of the merchants of
this kingdom and the obstruction of
its commerce."</p>

<p>The opposition to the abolition of
the slave trade was that of the merchants
and planters resident in England,
and to their influence on the
members of the colonial legislature
must be attributed whatever opposition
was offered by the latter. In the
interval between the abolition of
the slave trade and that of slavery,
the feelings of prejudice against them
grew still stronger. Every specific
measure by which this party proposed
to ameliorate the condition of the
slaves, was accompanied by some degrading
and disqualifying remarks on
the conduct of the resident inhabitants.
An act of individual guilt was
treated as a proof of the general
depravity of the whole community.
In consequence of the enthusiastic
ardour with which the abolition of
slavery was pursued, all the proposed
schemes of amelioration proceeded on
the erroneous assumption, that the
progress of civilisation and of moral
and religious advancement ought to
have been as rapid amongst the slave
population of the colonies, as it had
been in England and other parts of
Europe. It was forgotten, that until
the slave trade was abolished, the
inherent iniquity of which was aggravated
by the obstacle it afforded to the
progress of civilisation, every attempt
to diffuse moral and religious instruction
was impeded and counteracted
by the superstitions and vices which
were constantly imported from Africa.
Thus, instead of the conciliation which
would have rendered the colonists as
active and zealous, as they must always
be the <i>only efficient</i>, promoters of
amelioration, irritation was excited,
and they were almost proscribed, and
placed without the pale of all the
generous and candid, and just and
liberal feelings which characterise
Englishmen.</p>

<p>This state of public feeling operated
most injuriously in retarding and preventing
many measures of amelioration
which would have been made in
the slave codes of the several colonies.</p>

<p>Jamaica experienced, in a greater
degree than any other colony, the
effects of those unfavourable impressions
with which the motives and
proceedings of her legislature were
regarded, and of those feelings of distrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
and suspicion which influenced
the relations of the executive government
and the Assembly. Her Assembly
was more sensitive, more
zealous, more tenacious than any
other colony in vindicating the privileges
of her legislature, whenever an
attempt was made to violate them.
The people of Jamaica, when that
colony first formed part of the British
empire, did not become subjects of
England by conquest&mdash;they were by
birth Englishmen, who, by the invitation
and encouragement of their
sovereign, retained possession of a
country which its former inhabitants
had abandoned. They carried with
them to Jamaica all the rights and
privileges of British-born subjects.
The proclamation of Charles II. is
not a grant, but a declaration, confirmation,
and guarantee of those
rights and privileges. The constitution
of Jamaica is based on those
rights and privileges. It is, to use
the emphatic language of Mr Burke,
in speaking of our North American
colonies, "a constitution which, with
the exception of the commercial restraints,
has every characteristic of a
free government. She has the express
image of the British constitution. She
has the substance. She has the right
of taxing herself through her representatives
in her Assembly. She has,
in effect, the sole internal government
of the colony."</p>

<p>The history of the colony records
many attempts of the governor and of
the government to deprive her of that
constitution, by violating the privileges
of her Assembly; but it records
also the success with which those attempts
were resisted, and the full recognition
of those privileges by the
ample reparation which was made for
their violation. That very success
rendered the people of Jamaica still
more jealous of those privileges, and
more determined in the uncompromising
firmness with which they maintained
them. But it did not render
the governors or the home government
less jealous or less distrustful of
the motives and proceedings of the
Assembly. As the whole expense of
her civil, military, and ecclesiastical
establishment was defrayed by the
colony, with the exception of the salaries
of the bishop, archdeacon, and
certain stipendiary curates; and as
that expense, amounting to nearly
£400,000, was annually raised by the
Assembly, it might have been supposed
that the power of stopping the
supplies would have had its effect in
creating more confidence and conciliation,
but it may be doubted whether
it did not produce a contrary effect.</p>

<p>The feelings entertained by the government
towards the colonies, were
invoked by the intemperate advocates
for the immediate abolition of slavery,
as the justification of their unfounded
representations of the tyranny and
oppression with which the planters
treated their slaves. Happily, that
great act of atonement to humanity,
the abolition of slavery, has been accomplished;
but the faithful historian
of our colonies, great as his detestation
of slavery may and ought to be,
will yet give a very different representation
of the relation which subsisted between
master and slave. He will represent
the negroes on an estate to have
considered themselves, and to have
been considered by the proprietor,
as part of his family; that this self-constituted
relationship was accompanied
by all the kindly feelings which
dependence on the one hand, and protection
on the other, could create;
and that such was the confidence with
which both classes regarded each
other, that, with fearless security, the
white man and his family retired to
their beds, leaving the doors and windows
of their houses unclosed. These
kindly feelings, and that confidence,
were at length impaired by the increasing
attempts to render the employers
the objects of hatred. At
the latter end of 1831, a rebellion
of the most appalling nature broke
out amongst the slave population. A
district of country, not less than forty
miles in extent, was laid waste. Buildings
and other property, to the amount
of more than a million in value, exclusive
of the crops, were destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1833, the act for the abolition of
slavery was passed; and it cannot be
denied, that the feelings of distrust
and jealousy with which government
had so long regarded the Assembly
and their constituents, accompanied
its introduction, progress, and details.
They accompanied also the legislative
measures adopted by the Assembly
for carrying into effect its provisions,
and especially those for establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
and regulating the apprenticeship.
The manner in which the relative
rights and duties of master and apprentices
were discharged, was watched
and examined with the same unfavourable
feelings as if there had
existed a design to make the apprenticeship
a cover for the revival of
slavery&mdash;an object which, even had
there been persons wicked enough to
have desired it, could never have been
accomplished. There were persons in
Jamaica exercising a powerful influence
over the minds of the apprentices,
who proclaimed to them their
belief, that it was the design of their
masters to reduce them to slavery,
and who appealed to the suspicion and
jealousy of the government as justifying
and confirming that belief. Such
was the influence of those feelings,
that two attempts were made in Parliament
to abolish the apprenticeship.
They were unsuccessful; but enough
had been said and done to fill the
minds of the apprentices with the
greatest distrust and suspicion of their
masters. In June 1838, the Assembly
was especially convened for the purpose
of abolishing it. The governor,
as the organ of her Majesty's government,
distinctly told the Assembly
that it was impossible to continue the
apprenticeship. "I pronounce it,"
he says, "physically impossible to
maintain the apprenticeship, with any
hope of successful agriculture." The
state to which the colony had been
reduced, is told in the answer of the
Assembly to this address: "Jamaica
does, indeed, require repose; and we
anxiously hope, that should we determine
to remove an unnatural servitude,
we shall be left in the exercise
of our constitutional privileges, without
interference." The colony was
thus compelled to abolish the apprenticeship,
although it had formed part of
the plan of emancipation&mdash;not only that
it might contribute to the compensation
awarded for the abolition of slavery,
but that it might become that intermediate
state which might prepare the apprentices
for absolute and unrestricted
freedom, and afford the aid of experience
in such legislation as was
adapted to their altered condition. It
was again and again described by the
Secretary of State for the colonies, in
moving his resolutions, "to be necessary
not only for the security of the
master, but for the welfare of the
slave." The apprenticeship was thus
abruptly terminated two years before
the expiration of the period fixed by
the act of the Imperial Parliament for
its duration, before any new system of
legislation had been adopted, and when
the emancipated population had been
taught to regard the planters with far
less kindly feelings than those which
they entertained in their state of
slavery.</p>

<p>The difficulties and dangers with
which the colony was now threatened
were such as would have appalled any
prudent man, and would render it no
less his interest than his duty to assist
the Assembly in surmounting them.
It was, however, the misfortune of
Jamaica that her governor, from infirmity
of body and of temper, far
from endeavouring to surmount or
lessen, so greatly increased these
difficulties and dangers, that it appeared
scarcely possible to extricate
the colony from them. His conduct
in the session of November 1838 was
so gross a violation of the rights and
privileges of the Assembly, as to leave
that body no other alternative but
that of passing a resolution, by which
they refused to proceed to any other
business, except that of providing the
supplies to maintain the faith of the
island towards the public creditor,
until they had obtained reparation for
this violation.</p>

<p>This course had obtained the sanction,
not only of long usage and
practice, but of the government of
the parent state. The history of Jamaica
abounds in numerous instances
where governors, who had by their
conduct given occasion for its adoption,
had been either recalled, or ordered
by the Executive Government
to make such communication to the
Assembly as had the character of
being an atonement for the violation
of their privileges, and an express
recognition of them. Upon this resolution
being passed, the governor
prorogued the Assembly. On being
re-assembled, they adhered to their
former resolution. The governor dissolved
the Assembly. A general election
took place, when the same members
who had composed the large
majority concurring on that resolution,
were re-elected, and even an
addition made to their majority. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
Assembly, as might be expected, on
being convened, adhered to their former
resolution. It was then prorogued
until the 10th of July 1839.
The government, upon the urgent recommendation
of the governor, and
influenced by his misrepresentations,
proposed to Parliament a measure
for suspending the functions of the
Legislative Assembly. Unjustifiable
and reprehensible as this measure
was, yet it is only an act of justice to
the government of that day to
remember that it originated, not
only in the recommendation of the
governor, supported also by that
of the two preceding governors of
Jamaica, but was sanctioned, and
indeed urged on it, by several
influential Jamaica proprietors and
merchants, resident in London. Indeed,
until the bill had been some
time in the House of Commons, it
was doubtful whether it would be
opposed by Sir Robert Peel and his
adherents. The determination of several
members who usually supported
the government, to oppose a measure
destructive of the representative part
of the constitution of this great
colony, enabled him and his party
to defeat the bill on the second
reading. The government being
thus left in a minority, resigned;
but the attempt of Sir Robert Peel
to form a ministry having failed, the
former government was restored, and
they introduced another bill, equally
objectionable in its principles, and
equally destructive of the representative
branch of the Jamaica constitution.
An amendment was proposed
on the part of Sir Robert Peel, by the
party then considered Conservative;
but as the amendment would leave the
bill still inconsistent with the rights
of this popular branch of the constitution,
they were deprived of the
support of those who had before united
with them in their opposition to the
first bill, and they were therefore left in
a minority. The bill passed the House
of Commons. The amendment, which
had been rejected, was adopted by the
House of Lords, and the bill was
passed. The powerful speeches of
Lords Lyndhurst and Brougham, and
those of the other noble lords by whom
the amendment was supported, afford
abundant evidence that they disapproved
of the principles of the bill,
and were unanswered and unanswerable
arguments for its rejection.</p>

<p>Lord John Russell, and other members
of the government, might well
believe, and express their prediction,
that such a bill would not satisfy the
Assembly, but that they would still
refuse to resume their legislation; and
that in the next session the House
must adopt the original measure.</p>

<p>It was in the power of the ministry,
without resorting to any measure of
undue interference which could have
furnished their opponents with any
ground of censure, by passively leaving
the administration of the government
of the colony to its ordinary
course, and adopting the ordinary
means of selecting a governor, to
have fulfilled their own prediction.
They might thus have saved themselves
from the taunt with which
Sir Robert Peel, in the debate on
the 16th January 1840, attributed
the satisfactory manner in which
the Assembly of Jamaica had resumed
their legislative proceedings,
to "the opinion of the ministers having
been overruled." But the conduct
of Lord John Russell, who had
then accepted the seals of secretary
for the colonies, was influenced by
higher motives. He immediately applied
himself to secure, by confidence,
the cordial co-operation of the Assembly
of Jamaica, in that legislation
which should promote the best interests
of all classes of the community.
For the accomplishment of this object,
he anxiously sought for a governor who
united the discretion, the judgment,
the temper and firmness, which would
promote that confidence, and obtain
that co-operation, and, at the same
time, maintain the dignity of the executive,
and the supremacy of Parliament.</p>

<p>From no consideration of personal
or political connexion, but purely from
the conviction that Lord Metcalfe
was eminently distinguished by these
qualities, Lord John Russell offered
to him the Government of Jamaica.
He had just returned from the East
Indies, where he had displayed the
greatest ability, and met with almost
unexampled success. He had scarcely
tasted the sweets of the repose which
he had promised himself. His acceptance
of the Government was a sacrifice
of that repose to his high sense of
duty, and to the noble desire of rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span>
a great public service to his
country.</p>

<p>But to little purpose would such a
character have been selected, and to
little purpose would he have possessed
those eminent qualities, if he had been
sent to Jamaica with instructions
which would have controled their
exercise. A more wise, just, and
liberal policy was adopted by the government.
Lord Metcalfe was left
with the full, free, unfettered power
of accomplishing, in his own manner,
and according to his own discretion,
the great object of his administration.
Of the spirit of his instructions, and
of the discretion and powers confided
to him, he gives his own description
in his answer to an address which, on
his return to England, was presented
him by the Jamaica proprietors resident
in London, "I was charged by
her Majesty's government with a
mission of peace and reconciliation."</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to conceive a
public trust so full of difficulties, and
requiring the possession and exercise
of so many high and rare qualities for
its successful discharge, as the Government
of Jamaica at the time it
was undertaken by Lord Metcalfe.
Some account has been given of the
difficulties which attended the government
of every West Indian colony,
and of those which were peculiar to
that of Jamaica. It should be added,
that the office of Governor, independently
of the difficulties occasioned
by any particular event, is itself of
so peculiar a character as to require
no inconsiderable share of temper and
address as well as judgment. He is
the representative of his Sovereign,
invested with many of the executive
powers of sovereignty. He must constantly
by his conduct maintain the
dignity of his Sovereign. He cannot,
consistently with either the usages of
his office or the habits of society,
detach himself from the community
over which he presides as the representative
of his Sovereign. It is
necessary for him to guard against
a possibility of his frequent and
familiar intercourse with individuals,
impairing their respect for him
and his authority, and, at the same
time, not deprive himself of the
friendly disposition and confidence on
their part which that intercourse may
enable him to obtain. Especially
must he prevent any knowledge of
the motives and views of individuals
with which this intercourse may supply
him, from exercising too great, or,
indeed, any apparent influence on his
public conduct. It will be seen how
well qualified Lord Metcalfe was to
surmount, and how successfully he
did surmount, all these difficulties.</p>

<p>It has been stated, that the bill,
even with the amendment it received
in the House of Lords, was so inconsistent
with the constitutional rights
of Jamaica, that it was apprehended
there would be great reluctance on the
part of the Assembly to resume the
exercise of its legislative functions.
Considerations, which did honour to
the character of that body, induced
the members to overcome that reluctance,
even before they had practical
experience of the judicious and conciliatory
conduct of Lord Metcalfe,
and of the spirit in which he intended
to administer his government. There
was a party of noblemen and gentlemen,
possessing considerable property
in Jamaica, and of great influence in
England, at the head of whom was
that excellent man, the late Earl of
Harewood, who had given their most
cordial support, in and out of Parliament,
to the agent of the colony in
his opposition to the measure for
suspending the legislative functions
of the Assembly. They had thus
acquired strong claims on the grateful
attention of the legislature of Jamaica.
In an earnest and affectionate appeal
to the Assembly, they urged that body
to resume its legislation. The Assembly
and its constituents, with
the generosity which has ever distinguished
them, and with a grateful
sense of the powerful support they
had received from this party, felt the
full force of their appeal. Lord Metcalfe,
by his judicious conduct in
relation to the bill, by the conciliatory
spirit which his whole conduct on his
arrival in Jamaica, and first meeting
the Assembly, evinced, and by his
success in impressing the members
with the belief that her Majesty's
government was influenced by the
same spirit, inspired them with such
confidence in the principles on which
his government would be administered,
that they did not insist on their
objections to the bill, but resolved on
resuming their legislation. They did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span>
resume it. "They gave him," to use
his own language, "their hearty support
and active co-operation in adopting
and carrying into effect the views
of her Majesty's government, and in
passing laws adapted to the change
which had taken place in the social relations
of the inhabitants of Jamaica."</p>

<p>Before we state the principles on
which he so successfully conducted
the government of Jamaica, and endeavour
to represent the value of those
services which, by its administration,
he rendered to his country, we would
select some of those qualities essential
to constitute a great statesman, with
which he was most richly endowed.
He was entrusted with public duties
of great responsibility at a very early
period of life. Impressed with a deep
sense of that responsibility, he felt
that the faculties of his mind ought
to be not only dedicated to the discharge
of those duties, but that
he ought to bestow on them that
cultivation and improvement which
could enable his country to derive
the greatest benefit from them. He
acquired the power of taking an enlarged
and comprehensive view of all
the bearings of every question which
engaged his attention, and he exercised
that power with great promptitude.
He distinguished and separated
with great facility and with great
accuracy what was material from what
was not in forming his judgment.
He kept his mind always so well
regulated, and its powers so entirely
under his control&mdash;he preserved his
temper so calm and unruffled&mdash;he
resisted so successfully the approach
of prejudice, that he was enabled to
penetrate into the recesses of human
conduct and motives, and to acquire
the most intimate knowledge and the
most practical experience of mankind.</p>

<p>The acquisition of that experience is
calculated to impress the statesman
with an unfavourable opinion of his
species, and to excite too general a
feeling of distrust. This impression,
unless its progress and effects are controlled,
may exercise so great an influence
as effectually to disable the
judgment, frustrate the best intentions,
and oppose so many obstacles
as to render the noble character of
a great and good statesman wholly
unattainable. It is the part of
wisdom no less than of benevolence,
so far to control it, that it shall have
no other effect than that of inducing
caution, prudence, and circumspection.
He will regard it as reminding
him that those for whom he
thinks and acts, are beings with the
infirmities of our fallen nature; as
teaching him to appeal to, and avail
himself of the better feelings and
motives of our nature; and, whenever
it is practicable, to render those
even of an opposite character the
means of effecting good, and if that
be not practicable, to correct and control
them so as to deprive them of
their baneful effects.</p>

<p>Lord Metcalfe followed the dictates
of his natural benevolence, no less
than those of his excellent judgment,
in applying to those purposes, and in
this manner, his great knowledge and
experience of mankind. Burke, who
has been most truly called "the
greatest philosopher in practice whom
the world ever saw," has said, "that
in the world we live in, distrust is but
too necessary; some of old called it the
very sinews of discretion. But what
signify common-places, that always
run parallel and equal? Distrust is
good, or it is bad, according to our
position and our purpose." Again,
"there is a confidence necessary to
human intercourse, and without which
men are often more injured by their
own suspicions, than they would be
by the perfidy of others." No man
knew better or made a more wise and
judicious and successful application of
these maxims of wisdom and benevolence
than Lord Metcalfe. The
grateful attachment of the community
in which he lived abundantly proved
that distrust, when it was required by
his judgment, never impaired the
kindness of his own disposition, or
alienated from him the esteem and affection
of others.</p>

<p>The rock on which too often a
governor has made shipwreck of his
administration has been the selection
of individuals or families on whom he
bestowed his exclusive confidence.
The jealousy and envy which this
preference excited in others did not
constitute the only or even the greatest
part of the evil. The selected few
were desirous of making themselves
of importance, and inducing him to
value their support as essential to the
success of his government. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span>
this view they attributed to others
unfriendly feelings towards the governor
which they never entertained,
and endeavoured to persuade him
that they themselves were the only
persons on whom he could rely.
Their professions betrayed him into
the great error of too soon and too
freely making them acquainted with
the views and designs of his government.
Lord Metcalfe was too wise
and too just to have any favourites;
towards all, he acted with
a frankness, sincerity, and kindness
which made all equally his friends.
Lord Metcalfe united with singular
equanimity of temper, an extraordinary
degree of self-possession. He
never was betrayed into an intimation
of his opinions or intentions, if prudence
required that they should not
be known. The time when, and the
extent to which such intimation should
be given, were always the result of
his previous deliberate judgment. But
this reserve was accompanied with
so much kindness and gentleness of
manner, that it silenced any disappointment
or mortification in not attaining
that insight into his views
which was sought. A short intercourse
with Lord Metcalfe could not
fail to satisfy the mind that any attempt
to elicit from him opinions
which he did not desire to impart,
would be wholly fruitless.</p>

<p>Another evil, no less injurious to the
government than to the colony, was
the hasty and imperfect estimate
which governors formed of the motives
and conduct of colonial legislatures.
It had then been too frequent to
represent those bodies as influenced
by a hostile feeling, where no such
feeling existed, and to exaggerate their
difficulties in administering their government.
Lord Metcalfe's administration
was characterised by the candour
with which he appreciated, the
fidelity with which in his communications
to her Majesty's government he
represented, and the uncompromising
honesty and firmness with which he
vindicated the motives and acts of the
Jamaica legislature, and repelled the
prejudices, the misrepresentations, and
calumnies by which it had been
assailed. He brought to his administration,
and never failed to evince, a
constitutional respect for the institutions
of the colony, and the strictest
impartiality in maintaining the just
rights of all classes of the community.
Her Majesty's government continued
to him that unlimited confidence he so
well deserved, and left him to carry
out his wise and beneficent principles
of government. To cheer him in his
noble undertaking, to bestow on the
Assembly the most gratifying reward
for their conduct, and to give them
the highest assurance of the confidence
of the government, the royal speech
on the prorogation of Parliament contained
her Majesty's gracious approbation
of the disposition and proceedings
of the legislature.</p>

<p>So sound were the principles on
which he administered the government&mdash;so
firm and lasting was the confidence
reposed in him by the assembly,
that during his administration
there was not the slightest interruption
of the most perfect harmony
between him and the different branches
of the legislature. He had the satisfaction
of witnessing a most beneficent
change in the manner, the care, and
spirit in which the acts of the colonial
legislature were examined, objections
to them treated, and amendments
required, by the government. The
acts were not, as before, at once
disallowed; but the proposed amendments
were made the subjects of recommendation
by communications to
the legislature from the governor.
The Assembly felt this change, and met
it in a corresponding spirit, which
readily disposed them to adopt the
recommendations of the government.</p>

<p>Having fully and effectually accomplished
the noble and Christian purpose
with which he undertook the
arduous duties of the government, he
resigned it in June 1842. The state
in which he left Jamaica, contrasted
with that in which he found the colony
on the commencement of his administration,
was his rich reward. He came
to Jamaica at a time when her legislation
was suspended, mutual feelings
of distrust and jealousy disturbing not
only the relation between the governor
and the legislature, but all the social
relations in the colony; when laws
were required for the altered state of
society, and when the tranquillity and
existence of the colony were placed in
the greatest jeopardy. When he resigned
the government, there had been
effected a perfect reconciliation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
colony and the mother country; order
and harmony, and good feeling
amongst all classes had been restored;
legislation had been resumed, laws
had been passed adapted to the change
which had taken place in the social
relations of the inhabitants; and the
cordial and active co-operation of the
legislature had been afforded, notwithstanding
the financial difficulties of
the colony, in extending at a great
cost the means of religious and moral
instruction, and in making the most
valuable improvements in the judicial
system. He quitted the shores of
Jamaica beloved, respected, and revered,
with a gratitude and real attachment
which few public men ever
experienced. The inhabitants of Jamaica
raised to him a monument
which might mark their grateful homage
to his memory. But there is
engraven on the hearts of the public
of Jamaica another memorial, in
the affectionate gratitude and esteem
with which they will feel the enduring
blessings of his government, and recall
his Christian charity, ever largely
exercised in alleviating individual distress;
his kindness and condescension
in private life; and his munificent support
of all their religious and charitable
institutions, and of every undertaking
which could promote the prosperity
and happiness of the colony.</p>

<p>On Lord Metcalfe's arrival in England,
a numerous meeting of the Jamaica
proprietors and merchants was
held, and an address presented to him,
in which they offered him the tribute
of their warmest and sincerest gratitude
for the benefits which he had
conferred on the colony "by the eminent
talents, the wise, and just, and
liberal principles which made his administration
of the government a
blessing to the colony, and had secured
him the affection of all classes
of the inhabitants, as well as the high
approbation of his sovereign."</p>

<p>His answer to that address was a
beautiful illustration of the unaffected
modesty, of the kindness and benevolence
of his disposition, and of the
principles which influenced his administration.
"Charged by her Majesty's
government with a mission of
peace and reconciliation, I was received
in Jamaica with open arms.
The duties which I had to perform
were obvious; my first proceedings
were naturally watched with anxiety;
but as they indicated good-will and a
fair spirit, I obtained hearty support
and co-operation. My task in acting
along with the spirit which animated
the colony was easy. Internal differences
were adjusted&mdash;either by being
left to the natural progress of affairs,
during which the respective parties
were enabled to apprehend their real
interests; or by mild endeavours to
promote harmony, and discourage dissension.
The loyalty, the good sense,
and good feeling of the colony did
every thing."</p>

<p>The beneficial effects of his administration
did not cease on his resignation.
The principles on which he
had conducted it, were such, that an
adherence to them could not fail to
secure similar effects in every succeeding
government. It was his great object
to cultivate such mutual confidence
and good feeling between her Majesty's
government and the legislature,
and all classes of the colony, as would
influence and be apparent in the views
and measures of the government, and
as would secure the cordial co-operation
of the legislature in adopting
them. In promoting that object, he
was ever anxious to supply the government
with those means, which his
local information and experience could
alone furnish, of fully understanding
and justly appreciating the views and
measures of the Assembly. He was
sensibly alive to whatever might impair
the confidence of the government
in that body. It was his desire to
convey the most faithful representations
himself, and to correct any misrepresentations
conveyed by others.
In a word, it was his constant object
to keep the government fully and
faithfully informed of all which would
enable it to render justice to the
colony. Until Lord Metcalfe's administration,
her Majesty's government
never understood, and never rightly
appreciated, the motives and conduct
of the legislature of Jamaica, and
never did they know the confidence
which might be bestowed on that
legislature, and the all-powerful influence
which, by means of that confidence,
could be exercised on its
legislation. The foundation for the
most successful, because the most
beneficial, government was thus permanently
laid by Lord Metcalfe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Elgin succeeded Lord Metcalfe
as the governor of Jamaica.
He had the wisdom to follow the
example of his predecessor, and adopt
his principles of government, and pursue
the path which he had opened.
His administration was uninterrupted
by any misunderstanding between the
executive government and the Assembly.
It merited and received the
approbation of his sovereign, and the
gratitude of the colony.</p>

<p>More than six years have elapsed
since Lord Metcalfe entered on the
government of Jamaica. During that
space of time, in the former history of
the colony, there were frequent dissolutions
or prorogations caused by some
dispute between the government and
the Assembly, or between the different
branches of the legislature. Since the
appointment of Lord Metcalfe, no misunderstanding
has arisen, but perfect
harmony has prevailed amongst them.
The principles of Lord Metcalfe, which
established the relations between the
government of the parent state and
the various branches of the legislature
of Jamaica, and between all
classes of society there, in perfect
confidence and good feeling, and entirely
excluded distrust and suspicion,
were so strongly recommended by the
enduring success of his administration,
that it is not possible to anticipate
that they will ever be forgotten
or abandoned. There can be no difficulties
which may not be surmounted,
and confidence can never be supplanted
by distrust: there can be no governor
of Jamaica whose administration
will not have merited and received the
approbation of his sovereign, and the
gratitude of the colony, so long as he
religiously follows the example, and
adheres to the principles of Lord Metcalfe.
By such an adherence to these
principles, Jamaica will retain, not the
remembrance alone of the wisdom, the
justice, the benevolence of his administration,
and the blessings it conferred,
but she will enjoy, in every
succeeding generation, the same administration,
for although directed by
another hand, it will be characterised
by the sane wisdom, the same justice
and beneficence, and confer on her the
same blessings.</p>

<p>But as the beneficent effects of his
government are not limited in their duration
to the time, so neither are they
confined to the colony, in which it was
administered. The same experience of
its success, and the same considerations
no less of interest than of duty, recommend
and secure the adoption of
its principles in the administration of
the government of every other colony,
as well as of Jamaica. Such was the
impression with which the other British
colonies regarded his administration
in Jamaica. They considered
that the same principles on which the
government of Jamaica had been administered,
would be adopted in the
administration of their governments.
Shortly after Lord Metcalfe's return
from Jamaica, a numerous and influential
body, interested in the other
colonies, presented him with an address,
expressing "the sentiments of
gratitude and admiration with which
they appreciated the ability, the
impartiality, and the success of his
administration of the government of
Jamaica. They gratefully acknowledged
his undeviating adherence to
those just and liberal principles by
which alone the relations between the
parent state and the colonies can be
maintained with the feelings essential
to their mutual honour and welfare;
and they expressed their conviction,
that, as his administration must be
the unerring guide for that of every
other colony, so its benefits will extend
to the whole colonial empire of
Great Britain." Thus, by his administration
of the government of one
colony, during only the short space of
two years, he laid the foundation for
that permanent union of this and all
the other colonies with the parent
state, which would secure the welfare
and happiness of the millions by whom
they are inhabited, and add to the
strength, the power, and splendour of
the British empire.</p>

<p>Such is a faint record of only
two years of the distinguished public
life of this great and good man.
How few statesmen have ever furnished
materials for such a record?
What greater good can be desired for
our country, than that the example
of Lord Metcalfe, and his administration
of Jamaica, may ever be "the
guide-post and land-mark" in her
councils for the government of all her
colonies, and may ever exercise a predominant
influence in the relations
between them and the parent state?</p>

<h2>ANNALS AND ANTIQUITIES OF LONDON.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><i>An Antiquarian Ramble in the Streets of London; with Anecdotes of their more
celebrated Residents.</i> By J. T. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, late Keeper of the Prints and Drawings in
the British Museum, Author of <i>Nollekins and his Times</i>, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>


<p>What is London? Walk into Lombard
Street, and ask the Merchant;
he will tell you at once&mdash;the Docks
and the Custom-House, Lloyd's and
the Bank, the Exchange, Royal or
Stock. Drive your cab to the Carlton,
and learn that it is Pall-mall and
the Clubs, St James's and the Parks,
Almack's and the Opera. Carry your
question and your fee together to legal
chambers, and be told that it is Westminster
and Chancery Lane, Lincoln's
Inn and the Temple. All that remains
of mankind, that is not to be numbered
in these several categories, will
tell you it is a huge agglomeration
of houses and shops, churches and
theatres, markets and monuments,
gas-pipes and paving-stones. Believe
none&mdash;Yes, believe them all! We
make our London, as we make our
World, out of what attracts and interests
ourselves. Few are they who
behold in this vast metropolis a many-paged
volume, abounding in instruction,
offering to historian and philosopher,
poet and antiquary, a luxuriant
harvest and never-failing theme. We
consider London, with reference to
what it is and may become, not to
what it has been. The present and
the future occupy us to the exclusion
of the past. We perambulate the great
arteries of the Monster City, from
Tyburn to Cornhill, from Whitechapel
to the Wellington statue, and our
minds receive no impression, save
what is directly conveyed through our
eyes; we pass, unheeding, a thousand
places and objects rich in memories of
bygone days, of strange and stirring
events&mdash;great men long since deceased,
and customs now long obsolete. We
care not to dive into the narrow lanes
and filthy alleys, where, in former centuries,
sons of Genius and the Muses
dwelt and starved; we seek not the
dingy old taverns where the wit of
our ancestors sparkled; upon the spot
where a hero fell or a martyr perished,
we pause not to gaze and to recall
the memories of departed virtue and
greatness. We are a matter-of-fact
generation, too busy in money-getting
to speculate upon the past. So crowded
has the world become, that there
is scarce standing-room; and even the
lingering ghosts of olden times are
elbowed and jostled aside. It is the
triumph of the tangible and positive
over the shadowy and poetical.</p>

<p>Things which men will not seek,
they often thankfully accept when
brought to them in an attractive form
and without trouble. Upon this calculation
has the book before us been
written. It is an attempt to convey,
in amusing narrative, the history, ancient,
mediæval, and modern, of the
streets and houses of London. For
such a work, which necessarily partakes
largely of the nature of a compilation,
it is obvious that industry is
more essential than talent&mdash;extensive
reading than a brilliant pen. Both of
industry and reading Mr Smith makes
a respectable display, and therefore
we shall not cavil at any minor deficiencies.
His subject would have been
better treated in a lighter and more
detached form; and, in this respect,
he might have taken a hint from an
existing French work of a similar nature,
relating to Paris. But his materials
are too sterling and interesting
to be spoiled by any slight mistake in
the handling. He has accumulated a
large mass of information, quotation,
and extract; and although few persons
may read his book continuously
from beginning to end, very many, we
are sure, will dip with pleasure and
interest into its pages.</p>

<p>West and East would have been no
inappropriate title for Mr Smith's twin
volumes. In the first, he keeps on the
Court side of Temple Bar; the second
he devotes to the City. As may be
supposed, the former is the more
sprightly and piquant chronicle; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
the latter does not yield to it in striking
records and interesting historical
facts. Let us accompany the antiquarian
on his first ramble, from
Hyde Park Corner to Charing Cross,
starting from Apsley House, of which,
although scarcely included in the design
of his work, as announced on the
title-page, he gives, as of various
other modern buildings, a concise account.</p>

<p>How few individuals of the human
tide that daily flows and ebbs along
Piccadilly are aware, that within a
century that aristocratic quarter was
a most disreputable outlet from London.
The ground now covered with
ranges of palaces, the snug and select
district of May Fair, dear to opulent
dowagers and luxurious <i>célibataires</i>,
was occupied, but a short hundred
years since, by a few detached dwellings
in extensive gardens, and by a
far larger number of low taverns.
Some of these, as the White Horse
and Half Moon, have given their
names to the streets to which their
bowling-greens and skittle-alleys tardily
gave way. The Sunday excursions
of the lower orders were then more
circumscribed than at present; and
these Piccadilly publics were much
resorted to on the Sabbath, in the
manner of a country excursion; for
Piccadilly was then the country.
"Among the advertisements of sales
by auction in the original edition of
the <i>Spectator</i>, in folio, published in
1711, the mansion of Streater, jun.,
is advertised as <i>his country house</i>,
being near Bolton Row, in Piccadilly;
his town residence was in Gerrard
Street, Soho." The taverns nearest
to Hyde Park were chiefly patronised
by the soldiers, particularly, we are
informed, on review days, when they
sat in rows upon wooden benches,
placed in the street for their accommodation,
combing, soaping, and
powdering each other's hair. The
bad character of the neighbourhood,
and perhaps, also, the nuisance of
May Fair, which lasted for fifteen
days, and was not abolished till 1708,
prevented the ground from increasing
in value; and accordingly we find
that Mr Shepherd, after whom Shepherd's
Market was named, offered for
sale, as late as the year 1750, his
freehold mansion in Curzon Street,
and its adjacent gardens, for five
hundred pounds. At that price it
was subsequently sold. Houses there
were, however, in the then despised
neighbourhood of Piccadilly, of high
value; but it arose from their intrinsic
magnificence, which counterbalanced
the disadvantages of situation. Evelyn
mentions having visited Lord John
Berkeley at his stately new house,
which was said to have cost thirty
thousand pounds, and had a cedar
staircase. He greatly commends the
gardens, and says that he advised the
planting of certain holly-hedges on
the terrace. Stratton Street was built
on the Berkeley estate, and so named
in compliment to the Stratton line of
that family. At what is now the
south end of Albemarle Street, stood
Clarendon House, built, as Bishop
Burnet tells us, on a piece of ground
granted to Lord Clarendon by Charles
II. The Earl wished to have a plain
ordinary house, but those he employed
preferred erecting a palace, whose
total cost amounted to fifty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>"During the war," says the Bishop,
"and in the plague year, he had about
three hundred men at work, which
he thought would have been an
acceptable thing, when so many men
were kept at work, and so much
money, as was duly paid, circulated
about. But it had a contrary effect:
it raised a great outcry against him."
The sale of Dunkirk to the French
for four hundred thousand pounds,
had taken place only three years
before, and was still fresh in men's
minds. The odium of this transaction
fell chiefly on Lord Clarendon,
who was accused of pocketing a share
of its profits; and the people gave
the name of Dunkirk House to his
new mansion. Others called it Holland
House, thereby insinuating that
it was built with bribes received from
the Dutch, with whom this country
then waged a disastrous war. In
spite of popular outcry, however, the
house was completed in 1667, the year
of Clarendon's disgrace and banishment.
Fifteen years later, after his
death, his heir sold the place to the Duke
of Albemarle for twenty-five thousand
pounds, just half what it cost; and the
Duke parted with it for ten thousand
more. Finally, it was pulled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
to make room for Albemarle and
Stafford Streets; of which latter, as
appears from old plans of London,
the centre of Clarendon House occupied
the entire site.</p>

<p>Piccadilly was formerly the headquarters
of the makers of leaden
figures. The first yard for this worthless
description of statues was founded
by John Van Nost, one of the numerous
train of Dutchmen who followed
William III. to England. His establishment
soon had imitators and
rivals; and, in 1740, there were four
of these figure-yards in Piccadilly, all
driving a flourishing trade in their
leaden lumber. The statues were as
large as life, and often painted.
"They consisted of Punch, Harlequin,
Columbine, and other pantomimical
characters; mowers whetting
their scythes, haymakers resting on
their rakes, gamekeepers in the act
of shooting, and <i>Roman</i> soldiers with
<i>firelocks</i>; but, above all, that of a
kneeling African with a sundial upon
his head, found the most extensive
sale." Copies from the antique were
also there, and had many admirers;
but the unsuitableness of the heavy
and pliable material was soon discovered,
and, after a brief existence,
the figure-yards died a natural death.</p>

<p>On the etymology of the word
Piccadilly, Mr Smith expends much
erudite research, without, as it appears
to us, arriving at a very definite or
satisfactory conclusion. A pickadill
is defined by Blount, in his <i>Glossography</i>,
as "the round hem of a
garment, or other thing; also a kinde
of stiff collar, made in fashion of a
band." Hence Mr Smith infers, that
the famous ordinary near St James's,
which first bore the name of Piccadilly,
may have received it because at
that time it was the outmost or skirt-house
of the suburb. The derivation
is ingenious, but rather far-fetched.
Another notion is, that a certain
Higgin, a tailor, who built the house,
had acquired his money by the manufacture
of pickadills, then in great
vogue. The orthography of the name
has varied considerably. Evelyn mentions
in his memoirs, that, as one of
the commissioners for reforming the
buildings and streets of London, he
ordered the paving of the road from
St James's North, "which was a quagmire,"
and likewise of the Haymarket
about "Pigudello." In the same
year, however, 1662, it is found
inscribed in tradesmen's tokens as
Pickadilla; and this appears to be
the most ancient mode of spelling it.
In <i>Gerard's Herbal</i>, published in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, (1596,) the
author, talking of the "small wild
buglosse," says that this little flower
"growes upon the drie ditch bankes
about Pickadilla."</p>

<p>Where Bennet and Arlington Streets
now stand, was formerly the celebrated
mulberry gardens, referred to by Malone
as a favourite haunt of Dryden,
who loved to eat tarts there with his
mistress, Anne Reeve. To the polite
ears of the nineteenth century, the
very name of a public garden is a
sound of horror; and to see the cream
of <i>the ton</i> taking their evening lounge
at Cremorne, or the "Royal Property,"
and battening upon mulberry tarts and
sweetened wine, would excite as much
astonishment as if we read in the <i>Moniteur</i>
that the Duchess of Orleans
had led a <i>galop</i> at Musard's masquerade.
In the easy-going days of the
second Charles, things were very different,
and a fashionable company
was wont to collect at the Mulberry
Garden, to sit in its pleasant arbours,
and feast upon cheesecakes and syllabubs.
The ladies frequently went
in masks, which was a great mode at
that time, and one often adopted by
the court dames to escape detection
in the intrigues and mad pranks they
so liberally permitted themselves.
"In <i>The Humorous Lovers</i>, a comedy
written by the Duke of Newcastle,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and published in 1677, the
third scene of Act I. is in the Mulberry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
Garden. Baldman observes to Courtly,
''Tis a delicate plump wench; now, a
blessing on the hearts of them that
were the contrivers of this garden;
this wilderness is the prettiest convenient
place to woo a widow, Courtly.'"
One can hardly fancy a wilderness in
the heart of St James's, except of
houses; but the one mentioned in the
above passage had ceased to exist
at the time the play appeared, at
least as a place of public resort. Five
years previously, the King had granted
to Henry Earl of Arlington, "that
whole piece or parcel of ground called
the Mulberry Gardens, together with
eight houses, with their appurtenances
thereon," at a rent of twenty shillings
per annum. Goring House, in which
Mr Secretary Bennet, afterwards Earl
of Arlington, resided, was probably
one of these eight houses. Two years
subsequently to the grant, it was burnt
down, and the earl removed to Arlington
House, which stood on the
site of Buckingham Palace. Sheffield,
Duke of Buckingham, bought the
former, pulled it down in 1703, and
erected a new mansion, which was
sold to the crown by his son, and
allotted, in 1775, as a residence for
the Queen, instead of Somerset House.</p>

<p>We are glad to learn from Mr Smith,
that there is a plan on foot for the
removal of the confined, dirty, and
unwholesome district between Buckingham
Palace and Westminster Abbey,
now one of the vilest parts of
the metropolis, the favourite abode
of thieves, beggars, pawnbrokers, and
gin-sellers. The streets adjacent to
the palace have at no time been of
the most spacious or respectable description,
although Pimlico is vastly
improved from what it was in the
days of Ben Jonson, who uses the
name to express all that was lowest
and most disreputable. In his play
of <i>The Alchymist</i>, he says, "Gallants,
men and women, and of all
sorts, tag-rag and bob-tail, have been
seen to flock here in threaves, these
ten weeks, as to a second Hoxton or
Pimlico." And again, "besides other
gallants, oysterwomen, sailors' wives,
tobacco-men&mdash;another Pimlico." <i>Apropos</i>
of the gin-palaces which have
replaced the old-fashioned public-houses
that abounded some twenty
years ago in Westminster, Mr Smith
makes a digression on the subject of
drunkenness, and quotes some curious
particulars from an old treatise, called
<i>The London and Country Brewer</i>.
"Our drunkenness, as a national
vice," says the writer, "takes its date
from the restoration of Charles the
Second, or a few years later." It may
be questioned whether drunkenness
was not pretty well established as an
English vice long before the period
here referred to. We have the authority
of various writers, however, for
its having greatly increased about the
time of the Stuarts' restoration. "A
spirit of extravagant joy," says Burnet,
in his <i>History of his own Times</i>,
"spread over the nation. All ended
in entertainments and drunkenness,
which overrun the three kingdoms to
such a degree, that it very much corrupted
all their morals. Under the
colour of drinking the King's health,
there were great disorders, and much
riot every where." This was no unnatural
reaction after the stern austerity
of the Protectorate. "As to
the materials, (of drunkenness,") continues
<i>The Brewer</i>, "beer and ale
were considerable articles; they went
a great way in the work at first, but
were far from being sufficient; and
then strong waters came into play.
The occasion was this: In the Dutch
wars it had been observed that the
captains of the Hollanders' men-of-war,
when they were about to engage
with our ships, usually set a hogshead
of brandy abroach afore the mast, and
bid the men drink <i>sustick</i>, that they
might fight <i>lustick</i>; and our poor seamen
felt the force of the brandy to
their cost. We were not long behind
them; but suddenly after the war we
began to abound in strong-water
shops." Even the chandlers and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
barber-surgeons kept stores of spirituous
compounds, for the most part of
exceeding bad quality, but sweetened
and spiced, and temptingly displayed
in rows of glass bottles, under Latin
names of imposing sound. Aniseed-water
was the favourite dram; until
the French, finding out the newly-acquired
taste of their old enemies,
deluged the English markets with
brandy, which was recommended by
the physicians, and soon acquired
universal popularity. It was sold
about the streets in small measures,
at a halfpenny and a penny each; and
the consumption was prodigious, until
a war broke out with France, when
the supply of course stopped, and the
poor were compelled to return to their
<i>aqua vitæ</i> and <i>aqua mirabilis</i>, or, better
than either, to the ale-glass. When
speaking of the royal cockpit at Whitehall,
Mr Smith tells us of "Admiral
M'Bride, a brave sailor of the old
school, who constantly kept game-cocks
on board his ship, and on the
morning of an action, endeavoured,
and that successfully, to animate his
men by the spectacle of a cock-fight
between decks." This, if not a very
humane expedient, according to modern
notions, was at any rate an
improvement upon Dutch courage,
with which British seamen of the
present day would scorn to fortify
themselves.</p>

<p>St James's Park, originally a
swamp, was first inclosed by Harry
the Eighth, but little was done towards
its improvement and embellishment until
after the Restoration. It was within
its precincts, that in July 1626 Lord
Conway assembled the numerous and
troublesome French retinue of Queen
Henrietta Maria, and communicated
to them the king's pleasure that they
should immediately quit the country.
The legion of hungry foreigners, including
several priests and a boy
bishop, scarcely of age, had hoped
long to fatten upon English soil, and
they received their dismissal with
furious outcry and loud remonstrance.
Their royal mistress also was greatly
incensed, and broke several panes of
glass with her fists, in no very queenly
style. But Charles for once was resolute;
the Frenchmen had, to use his
own expressions, so dallied with his
patience, and so highly affronted him,
that he could no longer endure it.
They found, however, all sorts of
pretexts to delay their departure,
claiming wages and perquisites which
were not due, and alleging that they
had debts in London, and could not
go away till these were discharged.
L'Estrange, in his Life of Charles I.,
and D'Israeli in his <i>Commentaries</i>,
gives many curious particulars of the
proceedings of this troop of bloodsuckers.
Under pretence of perquisites,
they pillaged the queen's wardrobe
and jewel-case, not leaving her
even a change of linen. The king accorded
them a reasonable delay for
their preparations, but at last he lost
all patience, as will be seen by the
following characteristic letter to the
Duke of Buckingham, dated from
Oaking, the 7th of August 1626:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Steenie</span>,&mdash;I have received your
letter by Dic Greame, (Sir Richard
Graham.) This is my answer: I command
you to send all the French away
to-morrow out of the towne, if you can
by fair means, (but stike not long in
disputing,) otherways force them away,
dryving them away lyke so manie wilde
beastes, until ye have shipped them, and
so the devil goe with them. Let me
heare no answer, but of the performance
of my command. So I rest your faithful,
constant, loving friend, C. R."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thereupon the debts of the obnoxious
French were paid, their
claims, both just and unjust, satisfied,
presents given to some of them, and
they set out for Dover, nearly forty
coaches full. "As Madame St George,
whose vivacity is always described
as extremely French, was stepping
into the boat, one of the mob could
not resist the satisfaction of
flinging a stone at her French cap.
An English courtier, who was conducting
her, instantly quitted his
charge, ran the fellow through the
body, and quietly returned to the
boat. The man died on the spot, but
no further notice appears to have been
taken of the inconsiderate gallantry of
the English courtier."</p>

<p>The Stuarts were commonly plagued
with the foreign attendants of their
wives. When Charles the Second's
spouse, Catherine of Braganza, arrived
in England, she was escorted by
a train of Portuguese ladies, who
highly disgusted the king and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
court, less, however, by their Papistry
and greediness, than by their surpassing
ugliness and obstinate adherence
to the fashions of their country. "Six
frights," says Anthony Hamilton in
his memoirs of Count Grammont,
"who called themselves maids of
honour, and a duenna, another
monster, who took the title of governess
to these extraordinary beauties.
Among the men were Francisco de
Melo, and one Tauravedez, who called
himself Don Pedro Francisco Correo
de Silva, extremely handsome, but a
greater fool than all the Portuguese
put together; he was more vain of his
names than his person; but the Duke
of Buckingham, a still greater fool
than he, though more addicted to
raillery, gave him the name of Peter
of the Wood. He was so enraged at
this, that, after many fruitless complaints
and ineffectual menaces, poor
Pedro de Silva was obliged to leave
England; while the happy duke kept
possession of a Portuguese nymph
more hideous than the queen's maids
of honour, whom he had taken from
him, as well as two of his names.
Besides these, there were six chaplains,
four bakers, a Jew perfumer, and
a certain officer, probably without an
office, who called himself her highness's
barber." Evelyn also tells us,
that "the queen arrived with a train
of Portuguese ladies in their monstrous
fardingals or guard-infantas,
their complexions olivader, and sufficiently
unagreeable;" and Lord
Clarendon talks of "a numerous
family of men and women, that were
sent from Portugal"&mdash;the women "old
and ugly and proud, incapable of any
conversation with persons of quality
and a liberal education; and they
desired, and indeed had conspired
so far to possess the queen herself,
that she should neither learn the
English language, nor use their habit,
nor depart from the manners and
fashions of her own country in any
particulars." Although the Infanta
herself was by no means ill-looking,
her charms did not come up to those
of the flattered portrait which her
mother, the old Queen of Portugal,
had sent to Charles; and it is possible
that the selection of plain women for
her retinue had been intentional, that
their ugliness might serve as a foil to
her moderate amount of beauty. After
a short time, however, the majority
of these uncomely Lusitanians were
sent back to their native country.</p>

<p>To return to Mr Smith and St
James's Park. After his Restoration,
Charles the Second, who, as
worthy Thomas Blount says in his
Boscobel, had been hunted to and fro
like a "partridge upon the mountains,"
became very <i>casanier</i>, decidedly
stay-at-home, in his habits, and
cared little to absent himself from
London and its vicinity. He had had
buffeting and wandering enough in
his youth, and, on ascending the
throne of his unfortunate father, he
thought of little besides making himself
comfortable in his capital, careless
of expense, which, even in his greatest
need, he seems never to have calculated.
He planted the avenues of the
park, made a canal and an aviary for
rare birds, which gave the name to
Bird-Cage Walk. Amongst other
freaks, and to provide for a witty
Frenchman who amused him, he
erected Duck Island into a government.
Charles de St Denis, seigneur
of St Evremond, who had been
banished from France for a satire on
Cardinal Mazarine, was the first and,
it is believed, the last governor. He
drew the salary attached to the appointment,
which was certainly a more
lucrative than honourable one for a
man of his talents and reputation.
According to Evelyn, Charles stored
the park with "numerous flocks of
fowle. There were also deer of several
countries&mdash;white, spotted like leopards;
antelopes, as elk, red deer,
roebucks, staggs, Guinea grates, Arabian
sheep," &amp;c. In the Mall, also
made by him, Charles played at ball
and took his daily walk. "Here,"
says Colley Cibber, "Charles was
often seen amid crowds of spectators,
feeding his ducks and playing with
his dogs, affable even with the meanest
of his subjects." Mr Smith regrets
the diminished affability and
less accessible mood of sovereigns of
the nineteenth century, although he
admits that the populace of France
and England are at the present day
too rude for it to be advisable that
kings and queens should walk amongst
them with the easy familiarity of the
second Charles. Of that there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
be very little doubt. Even Charles,
whose dislike of ceremony and restraint,
and love of gossip and new
faces, were cause, at least as much as
any desire for popularity, that he thus
mingled with the mob, occasionally
experienced the disagreeables of his
undignified manner of life. Aubrey
the credulous, Mr Smith tells us, relates
in his Miscellanies the following
anecdote of an incident that occurred
in the Park. "Avise Evans had a
fungous nose, and said that it was
revealed to him that the king's hand
would cure him: and at the first
coming of King Charles II. into St
James's Park, he kissed the king's
hand, and rubbed his nose with it,
which disturbed the king, but cured
him." It was whilst walking on the
Mall that the pretended Popish plot of
Oates and Bedloe was announced
to Charles. "On the 12th of August
1678," says Hume, "one Kirby, a
chemist, accosted the king as he was
walking in the Park. 'Sir,' said he,
'keep within the company; your
enemies have a design upon your life,
and you may be shot in this very
walk.' Being asked the reason of
these strange speeches, he said that
two men, called Grove and Pickering,
had engaged to shoot the king, and
Sir George Wakeman, the queen's
physician, to poison him." Charles,
unlike his grandfather, the timid
James, was little apprehensive of assassination,
and, when sauntering in
the Park, preferred the society of two
or three intimates to the attendance
of a retinue. On one occasion, however,
as a biographer has recorded,
an impudent barber startled him from
his usual happy <i>insouciance</i>. Accustomed
to chat familiarly with his
good-humoured master, the chin-scraper
ventured to observe, whilst
operating upon that of the king, that
he considered no officer of the court
had a more important trust than himself.
"Why so, friend?" inquired
the king. "Why," replied the barber,
"I could cut your majesty's throat
whenever I chose." Charles started
up in consternation, swore that the
very thought was treason, and the indiscreet
man of razors was deprived
of his delicate charge.</p>

<p>In the <i>Daily Post</i> for October 31st,
1728, is an order of the Board of
Green Cloth for clearing St James's
Park of the shoe-cleaners and other
vagrants, and sending them to the
House of Correction. This reminds us
of what has often excited our surprise,
the absence from the streets of London
of an humble but very useful
class of professionals, who abound in
many continental towns, in all French
ones of any size. Abundant ingenuity
is displayed in London in the
discovery and invention of strange
and out-of-the-way employments.
Men convert themselves into "animated
sandwiches" by back and
breastplates of board, encase themselves
in gigantic bottles to set forth
the merits of some famed specific or
potent elixir, or walk about with
advertisements printed on their coats,
peripatetic fly-sheets, extolling the
comfort and economy of halfpenny
steamers, and of omnibuses at a
penny a mile. Some sweep crossings,
others hold horses; but none of the
vast number of needy <i>industrials</i> who
strain their wits to devise new means of
obtaining their daily ration and nightly
shelter, have as yet taken pattern
by the French <i>décrotteur</i> and
German <i>stiefel-wichser</i>, and provided
themselves for stock in trade with a
three-legged stool, a brace of brushes,
and a bottle of blacking. No one
has been at Paris without finding the
great convenience of the <i>ateliers de
décrottage</i> which abound in the passages
and in the more frequented of
the streets, where, for three or four
<i>sous</i>, the lounger who has had boots
and trousers bemired by rapid cab or
lumbering <i>diligence</i>, is brushed and
polished with unparalleled rapidity and
dexterity. But a very moderate capital
is required for the establishment
of these temples of cleanliness, and
we recommend the subject to the consideration
of decayed railway "stags."</p>

<p>"Duke Street Chapel, with a flight
of steps leading to the Park, formed
originally a wing of the mansion of
the notorious Judge Jeffries. The
house was built by him, and James
the Second, as a mark of especial favour,
allowed him to make an entry
to the Park by the steps alluded to.
The son of Jeffries inhabited it for
a short time." It was this son and
successor of the infamous Jeffries,
who, with a party of rakes and debauchees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
mohocks as they were at
that time called, insulted the remains
of the poet Dryden, and the grief of
his widow. They happened to pass
through Gerrard Street, Soho, when
Dryden's remains were about to be
conveyed from his house, No. 43, in
that street, to Westminster Abbey.
Although it was in the daytime,
Jeffries was drunk; he swore that
Dryden should not be buried in so
shabby a manner, (eighteen mourning
coaches waited to form the procession,)
and that he would see due honour
done to his remains. After frightening
Lady Elizabeth, who was ill in
bed, into a fainting fit, these aristocratic
ruffians stopped the funeral,
and sent the body to an undertaker
in Cheapside. The bishop waited
several hours in Westminster Abbey,
and at last went away. When Jeffries
became sober, he had forgotten
all about the matter, and refused to
have any thing to do with the interment.
The corpse lay unburied for
three weeks. At last the benevolent
Dr Garth had it taken to the College
of Physicians, got up a subscription
for the expenses of the funeral, and
followed the body to Westminster
Abbey. The poet's son challenged
Jeffries, but Jeffries showed the white
feather, and, to avoid personal chastisement,
kept carefully out of the
way for three years, when Charles
Dryden was drowned near Windsor.</p>

<p>Mr Smith is most indulgent to the
blunders and blockheadism of our modern
architects and monument-makers,
far too much so, indeed, when he speaks
approvingly of Trafalgar Square and
its handsome fountains, and without
positive disapprobation of the vile
collection of clumsy buildings and ill-executed
ornament defacing that site.
There has been a deal of ink spilt
upon this subject, and we have no
intention of adding to the quantity,
especially as there is no chance that
any flow of fluid, however unlimited,
shall blot out the square and its
absurdities. But we defy any Englishman,
with the smallest pretensions
to taste, to pass Charing Cross without
feelings of shame and disgust at
the mismanagement and ignorance
there manifest. Such an accumulation
of clumsiness was surely never
before witnessed. The wretched National
Gallery with its absurd dome,
crushed beneath the tall and symmetrical
proportions of St Martin's portico,
overtopped even by the private
dwelling-houses in its vicinity; the
dirty, ill-devised, and worse-executed
fountains, with their would-be-gracefully
curved basins, the steps and
parapets, which give the whole place
the appearance of an exaggerated
child's toy. Well may foreigners
shrug their shoulders, and smile at the
public buildings of the great capital
of Britain. A fatality attends all our
efforts in that way. In regard to
architecture and ornament, we pay
more and are worse served than any
body else. So habituated are we to
failure in this respect, that when a
public building is completed, scaffolding
removed, and a fair view obtained,
we wonder and exult if it is found
free from glaring defects, and in no
way particularly obnoxious to censure.
As to its proving a thing to be proud
of, to be gazed at and admired, and
to be spoken of out of England, or
even in England, after the fuss and
ceremony of its inauguration is over,
we never dream of such a thing. The
negative merit of having avoided the
ridiculous and the grotesque, is subject
for satisfaction, almost for pride.
Assuredly we love not to exalt other
countries at the expense of our own,
to draw invidious comparisons between
things English and things foreign.
But the difference between
public buildings of modern erection
in London and in Paris is so immense,
that it can escape no one. Take, for
instance, the Paris <i>Bourse</i> and the
London Exchange. The former, it
has been objected, is out of character;
a Greek temple is no fitting rendezvous
for the sons of commerce; a less
classic fane were more appropriate for
the discussion of exchanges, for sales
of cotton and muscovado. The objection,
according to us, is flimsy and
absurd, and must have originated with
some Vandalic and prejudiced booby,
with whom consistency was a monomania.
Nevertheless we will, for
argument's sake, admit its validity.
Is that a reason that the traders and
capitalists of London should meet in
a building which, for heaviness and
exaggerated solidity, rivals a South
American Inquisition? Do the Barings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
and the Rothschilds anticipate
an attack upon their strong boxes,
and intend to stand a siege within the
massive walls of the Royal Exchange?
Assuredly the narrow doorways may
easily be defended; for a time, at
least, the ponderous walls will mock
the cannonade. The curse of heaviness
is upon our architects. There is
total want of grace, and lightness,
and airiness in all their works. Behold
our new Senate House! Do its
florid beauties and overdone decorations,
unsparingly as they have been
lavished, and convenient as they will
doubtless be found as receptacles for
bird's nests, contrast favourably with
the elegant and dignified simplicity of
the Chamber of Deputies? The two,
it will be said, cannot be assimilated:
the vast difference of size precludes a
comparison. We reply, that the buildings
are for the same purpose; but
were they not, proportion at least
should be observed. The Parliament
House is far too low for its length.
Want of elevation is the common
fault, both in the ideas and in the
productions of our architects.</p>

<p>Are we more successful in statues
than in buildings? Mr Smith has
some sensible remarks on this score.
Speaking of the equestrian statue of
George III. in Cockspur Street, he
says, that "critics object to the cocked
hat and tie-wig in the royal figure;
but, some ages hence, these abused
parts will be the most valuable in the
whole statue. It may very reasonably
be asked, why an English gentleman
should be represented in the dress of
a Roman tribune? Let the man appear,
even in a statue, in his habit as
he lived; and whatever <i>we</i> may say,
posterity will be grateful to us. We
should like to know exactly the ordinary
walking-dress of Cæsar or Brutus,
and how they wore their hair; and we
should not complain if they had cocked
hats or periwigs, if we knew them to
be exact copies of nature." It is
certain that modern physiognomy
rarely harmonises with ancient costume.
What is to be said of the
aspect of the "first gentleman of
Europe," wrapped in his horsecloth,
and astride on his bare-backed steed,
in the aforesaid Square of Trafalgar?
Assuredly nothing in commendation.
There are portraits of Napoleon in
classic drapery, and, even with his
classically correct countenance, he
looks a very ordinary, under-sized
Roman. But, in his grey <i>capote</i> and
small cocked hat, the characteristic is
preserved, and we at once think of,
and wonder at, the hero of Austerlitz
and Marengo.</p>

<p>Leicester Square, as Mr Smith
justly observes, has more the appearance
of the <i>Grande Place</i> of some
continental city than of a London
square. The headquarters and chief
rendezvous of aliens, especially of
Frenchmen, it bears numerous and
unmistakeable marks of its foreign
occupancy. French hotels and restaurants
replace taverns and chop-houses.
French names are seen above shops;
promises of French, German, and
Spanish conversation, are read in the
windows; and grimy-visaged, hirsute
individuals, in plaited pantaloons and
garments of eccentric cut, saunter,
cigar in mouth, over the shabby pavement.
It is curious to remark the
different tone and station taken by
English in Paris and French in London.
In the former capital, nothing
is too good for the intruding islanders.
In the best and most expensive
season, they throng thither, and strut
about like lords of the soil, perfectly
at home, and careless of the opinions
of the people amongst whom they
have condescended to come. The best
houses are for their use; the most
expensive shops are favoured with
their custom; and if occasionally
tormented by a troublesome consciousness
of paying dearly for their
importance, they easily console themselves
by a malediction on the French
<i>voleurs</i>, who thus take advantage of
their long purses and open hands.
How different is it with the Frenchman
in London! He comes over, for
the most part, at the dullest time of
the year, in the autumn, when the
town is foggy, and dreary, and empty;
when the Parks are deserted, shutters
shut, the theatres dull, and exhibitions
closed. He has certain vague apprehensions
of the tremendous expense
entailed by a visit to the English
capital. To avoid this, he makes a
toil of a pleasure; wearies himself
with economical calculations; and
creeps into some inferior hotel or dull
lodging-house, tempted by low prices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
and foreign announcements. We find
French deputies abiding in Cranbourn
Street, and counts contenting themselves
with a garret at Pagliano's.
Thence they perambulate westwards;
and ignorant, or not choosing to remember,
that London is out of town,
and that they have selected the very
worst possible season to visit it, they
greatly marvel at the paucity of equipages,
at the abundance of omnibuses
and hack-cabs, and the scarcity of
sunbeams; and return home to inform
their friends that London is a <i>ville
monstre</i>, with spacious streets, small
houses, few amusements; very great,
but very gloomy; and where the
nearest approach to sunshine resembles
the twinkling of a rushlight
through a plate of blue earthenware.</p>

<p>"The foreign appearance of Leicester
Square is not of recent growth.
It seems to have been the favourite
resort of strangers and exiles ever
since the place was built. Maitland,
who wrote more than a hundred years
ago, describing the parish of St Anne's,
in which it is situate, says&mdash;'The
fields in these parts being but lately
converted into buildings, I have not
discovered any thing of great antiquity
in this parish. Many parts of it so
greatly abound with French, that it
is an easy matter for a stranger to
imagine himself in France.'"</p>

<p>Sydney Alley is named after the
Earls of Leicester, who had their
town-house on the north side of the
square, where Leicester Place has
since been opened. Elizabeth, Queen
of Bohemia, daughter of James I.,
occupied, for some years, this residence
of the Sydneys. She also
inhabited a house in Drury Place,
where Craven Street now stands, which
was built for her by Lord Craven. It
was called Bohemia House for many
years afterwards, and at last became
a tavern, at the sign of the Queen of
Bohemia. "The Earl of Craven was
thought to have been privately married
to the queen, a woman of great
sweetness of temper and amiability of
manners&mdash;a universal favourite both
in this country and Bohemia, where
her gentleness acquired her the title
of 'The Queen of Hearts.' By right
of their descent from her, the House
of Hanover ascended the throne of
this kingdom." Lord Craven was the
eldest son of Sir William Craven,
lord-mayor of London in 1611. He
fought under Gustavus Adolphus with
great distinction, and returned to England
at the Restoration, when Charles
II. made him viscount and earl. He
commanded a regiment of the guards
until within three or four years of his
death, which occurred in 1697, at the
advanced age of eighty-five. "He
was an excellent soldier," says the
advertisement of his decease in No.
301 of the <i>Postman</i>, "and served
in the wars under Palsgrave of the
Rhine, and also under the great Gustavus
Adolphus, where he performed
sundry warlike exploits to admiration;
and, in a word, he was then in
great renowne."</p>

<p>However indifferently Leicester
Square may at present be inhabited,
and notwithstanding its long-standing
reputation as a foreign colony, it has
been the chosen abode of many distinguished
men. Hogarth and Reynolds
lived and died there. Hogarth's
house is now part of the Sablonière
Hotel. Sir Joshua's was on the opposite
side of the square; and both of
them, especially the latter, were much
resorted to by the wits and wise men
of the day. Johnson, Boswell, and,
at times, Goldsmith, were constant
visitors to Reynolds. John Hunter,
the anatomist, lived next-door to
Hogarth's house; and in 1725, Lords
North and Grey, and Arthur Onslow,
the Speaker, also inhabited this square.
Leicester House, where the Queen of
Bohemia lived, is called by Pennant
the "pouting-place of princes." George
II. retired thither when he quarrelled
with his father; and his son Frederick,
the father of George III., did
the same thing for the same reason.
Whilst Prince Frederick and the
Princess of Wales lived there, they
received the wedding visit of the Hon.
John Spencer, ancestor of the present
Earl Spencer, and of his bride, Miss
Poyntz. Contrary to established etiquette,
the bridal party went to visit
the Prince before paying their respects
to the King. They came in two carriages
and a sedan chair; the latter,
which was lined with white satin,
contained the bride, and was preceded
by a black page, and followed by three
footmen in splendid liveries. The
diamonds presented to Mr Spencer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
on occasion of his marriage, by Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough, were worth
one hundred thousand pounds. The
bridegroom's shoe-buckles alone cost
thirty thousand pounds. An old
gentleman, born more than a century
ago, from whom Mr Smith obtained
some of these particulars, informed
him, that about that time the neighbourhood
was so thinly built, that
when the heads of two men, executed
for participation in the Scotch rebellion,
were placed on Temple Bar, a
man stood in Leicester Fields with a
telescope, to give the boys a sight of
them for a penny a-piece.</p>

<p>A house in Leicester Fields was the
scene of some of the eccentricities of
that semi-civilised hero, Peter the
Great of Russia. It belonged to the
Earl of Aylesbury, and was inhabited,
during the Czar's visit to this
country, by the Marquis of Carmarthen,
who gave a grand ball there, on
the 2d April 1698, in honour of the
imperial stranger. The Marquis was
Peter's particular chum and boon companion,
and the Czar preferred his
society to all the gaieties and visitors
that beset him during his residence
in England. Peter was very shy of
strangers, and when William the
Third gave him a magnificent entertainment
at St James's, he would not
mix with the company, but begged
to be put into a cupboard, whence he
could see without being seen. He
drank tremendously, and made Lord
Carmathen do the same. Hot brandy,
seasoned with pepper, was his
favourite drink. Something strong
he certainly required to digest his
diet of train-oil and raw meats.
On one occasion, when staying in
Leicester Fields with the Marquis,
he is said to have drunk a pint of
brandy and a bottle of sherry before
dinner, and eight bottles of sack
after it, and then to have gone to the
play, seemingly no whit the worse.
He lodged in York Buildings, in a
house overlooking the river, supposed
by some to be that at the left-hand
corner of Buckingham Street. A
house in Norfolk Street also had
the honour of sheltering him. "On
Monday night," says No. 411 of the
<i>Postman</i> "the Czar of Muscovy arrived
from Holland, and went directly
to the house prepared for him
in Norfolk Street." His principal
amusement was being rowed on the
Thames between London and Deptford;
and at last, in order to live
quietly and avoid the hosts of visitors
who poured in upon him, he took Admiral
Benbow's house at the latter
place. It stood on the ground now
occupied by the Victualling Office,
and was the property of the well-known
John Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Horne Tooke," says Mr Smith,
"in his <i>Diversions of Purley</i>, derives
the word Charing from the Saxon
<i>Charan</i>, to turn; and the situation
of the original village, on the bend or
turning of the Thames, gives probability
to this etymology." Every
body knows that Charing, now so
central a point, was once a little
hamlet on the rural high-road between
London and Westminster, and
that the "Cross" was added to it
by Edward the First, who, when
escorting his wife's remains from
Lincolnshire to Westminster Abbey,
erected one at each place where the
beloved corpse rested. The first
cross, which was of wood, and probably
of rude enough manufacture,
gave way to one of stone, designed
by Cavalini. About the middle of
the seventeenth century, that period
of puritanical intolerance, this was
removed by order of the Commons'
House, an order which the royalists
took care to ridicule by song and
lampoon. According to Lilly the astrologer
and quack, the workmen
were three months pulling it down,
and some of the stones were used
for the pavement before Whitehall.
Others were made into knife-handles,
and Lilly saw some of them which
were polished and looked like marble.
Those were days in which kingly
memorials found as little favour as
popish emblems; and after the death
of Charles the First, the statue that
now stands at Charing Cross, and
which had been cast by Le Sueur in
1633 for the Earl of Arundel, was
sold and ordered to be broken up.
It was bought by one Rivet, a brazier,
who, instead of breaking, buried
it. This did not prevent the ingenious
mechanic from making a large
and immediate profit by the effigy of
the martyred monarch; for he melted
down old brass into knife and fork-handles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
and sold them as proceeding
from the King's statue. Roundheads
and cavaliers all flocked to buy; the
former desiring a trophy of their triumph,
the latter eager to possess a
memento of their lamented sovereign.
In 1678, £70,000 was voted by Parliament
for the obsequies of Charles
I., and for a monument to his memory,
and with a portion of this sum,
how large a one is not known, the
statue was repurchased.</p>

<p>The historian of the streets and
houses of a great and ancient city,
has, in many ways, a most difficult
task to perform. Not only must he read
much, observe closely, and diligently
inquire, display ingenuity in deduction
and judgment in selection, but
he must be steadfast to resist temptation.
For, assuredly, to the lover of
antiquarian and historical lore, the
temptation is immense, whilst culling
materials from quaint old diaries,
black-letter pamphlets, and venerable
newspapers, to expatiate and extract
at a length wholly inconsistent with
the necessary limits of his work.
Some writers are at pains to dilate
their matter&mdash;his chief care must be
to compress. What would fairly fill
a sheet must be packed into a page&mdash;the
pith and substance of a volume
must be squeezed into a chapter.
The diligent compiler should not be
slightly considered by the creative
and aspiring genius. Like the bee,
he forms his small, rich store, from
the fragrance of a thousand flowers&mdash;adopting
the sweet, rejecting the
nauseous and insipid. Nor must he
dwell too long on any pet and particular
blossom, lest what would please
in due proportion should cloy by too
large an admixture. To vary the
metaphor, the writer of such a work
as this <i>Antiquarian Ramble</i>, should be
a sort of literary Soyer, mixing his
materials so skilfully that the flavour
of each is preserved, whilst not one
unduly predominates. He must not
prance off on a hobby, whether architectural,
historical, social, or romantic,
but relieve his cattle and his
readers by jumping lightly and frequently
from one saddle to another.</p>

<p>How many books might be written
upon the themes briefly glanced at in
Mr Smith's book! Let us take, for
instance, the places of public executions
in London. Charing Cross was
for centuries one of them, and its pillory
was the most illustrious amongst
the many that formerly graced the
capital&mdash;illustrious by reason of the
remarkable evil-doers who underwent
ignominy in its wooden and
unfriendly embrace. The notorious
Titus Oates, and Parsons, the chief
contriver of the Cock-Lane Ghost,
were exposed in it. To the rough
treatment which, in former days,
sometimes succeeded exposure in the
pillory, the following paragraph, from
the <i>Daily Advertiser</i> of the 11th June
1731, abundantly testifies:&mdash;"Yesterday
Japhet Crook, <i>alias</i> Sir Peter
Stranger, stood on the pillory for the
space of one hour; after which he was
seated in an elbow-chair, and the
common hangman cut both his ears
off with an incision knife, and showed
them to the spectators, afterwards
delivered them to Mr Watson, a sheriff's
officer; then slit both his nostrils
with a pair of scissors, and sear'd
them with a hot iron, pursuant to his
sentence. He had a surgeon to attend
him to the pillory, who immediately
applied things necessary to prevent
the effusion of blood. He underwent
it all with undaunted courage; afterwards
went to the Ship tavern at
Charing Cross, where he stayed some
time; then was carried to the King's
Bench Prison, to be confined there
for life. During the time he was on
the pillory he laughed, and denied the
fact to the last." Petty punishments
these, although barbarous enough,
inflicted for paltry crimes upon mean
malefactors. Criminals of a far higher
grade had, previously to that, paid
the penalty of their offences at the
Cross of Charing. Hugh Peters,
Cromwell's chaplain, was there hung,
as were Scrope, Jones, Harrison, and
others of the king-killers. Long had
been their impunity; but vengeance
at last overtook them. To the end
they showed the stern fanatical resolution
of Oliver's iron followers.
"Where is your <span class="smcap">Good Old Cause</span>?"
cried a scoffer to Harrison, as he was
led to the scaffold. "Here!" he replied,
clapping hand on breast; "I
go to seal it with my blood." At the
foot of the ladder, which he approached
with undaunted mien, his limbs
were observed to tremble, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[685]</a></span>
amongst the mob made a mockery of
this weakness. "I judge," said Harrison,
"that some do think I am
afraid to die, by the shaking I have
in my hands and knees. <i>I</i> tell you
NO! but it is by reason of much
blood that I have lost in the wars,
and many wounds I have received in
my body, which caused this shaking
and weakness in my nerves." And he
spoke further, and told the populace
how he gloried in that he had done,
and how, had he ten thousand lives,
he would cheerfully lay them down
in the same cause. "After he was
hanged, a horrible scene took place.
In conformity to the barbarous sentence
then, and for many years afterwards,
executed upon persons convicted
of treason, he was cut down
alive and stripped, his belly was cut
open, his bowels taken out and burned
before his eyes. Harrison, in the
madness of his agony, rose up wildly,
it is said, and gave the executioner a
box on the ear, and then fell down
insensible. It was the last effort of
matter over mind, and for the time it
conquered." The other regicides died
with the same firmness and contempt
of death. "Their grave and graceful
demeanour," says the account in the
state trials, "accompanied with courage
and cheerfulness, caused great
admiration and compassion in the
spectators." So much so, and so
strong was the sympathy excited,
that the government gave orders that
no more of them should be executed
in the heart of London. Accordingly
the remainder suffered at Tyburn.</p>

<p>Upon the old Westminster market-place
a most barbarous event occurred
in the time of that tyrannical, acetous
old virgin, Queen Bess, who assuredly
owes her renown and the sort of halo
of respect that surrounds her memory,
far less to any good qualities of her
own, than to the galaxy of great men
who flourished during her reign. The
glory that encircles her brow is formed
of such stars as Cecil, Burleigh and
Bacon, Drake and Raleigh, Spencer,
Shakspeare, and Sydney. Touching
this barbarity, however, enacted by
order of good Queen Bess. At the
mature age of forty-eight, her majesty
took it into her very ordinary-looking
old head to negotiate a marriage
with the Duke of Anjou. Commissioners
came from France to discuss
the interesting subject, and were
entertained by pageants and tournaments,
in which Elizabeth enacted
the Queen of Beauty; and subsequently
the duke came over himself,
as a private gentleman, to pay his
court to the last of the Tudors. The
duke being a papist, the proposed alliance
was very unpopular in England,
and one John Stubbs, a barrister
of Lincoln's-Inn, wrote a pamphlet
against it, entitled, "The Discoverye
of a gaping gulphe, whereinto
England is like to be swallowed by
another French marriage, if the Lord
forbid not the banns, by letting her
Majestye see the sin and punishment
thereof." Certain expressions in this
imprudent publication greatly angered
the Queen; Stubbs and his servant,
Page, were brought to trial, and condemned
to lose their right hands.
This cruel and unusual sentence was
carried into effect on the market-place
at Westminster, and witnessed by
Camden, who gives an account of it.
Both sufferers behaved with great fortitude
and courage. Their hands were
cut off with a butcher's cleaver and
mallet, and as soon as Stubbs had
lost his, he pulled off his cap with his
left, waved it in the air, and cried&mdash;"God
save the Queen!" He then
fainted away. It took two blows to
sever Page's hand, but he flinched
not, and pointing to the block where
it lay, he exclaimed&mdash;"I have left
there the hand of a true Englishman!"
And so he went from the scaffold,
says the account, "stoutlie and with
great courage."</p>

<p>Amongst spots of sanguinary notoriety,
Smithfield, of course, stands prominent.
The majority of the two
hundred and seventy-seven persons
burned for heresy during Mary's short
reign, suffered there; and here also,
upon two occasions, the horrible punishment
of boiling to death, formerly
inflicted on poisoners, was witnessed.
In France this was the punishment of
coiners, and there is still a street at
Paris known as the <i>Rue de l'Echaudé</i>.
In Stow's <i>Annals</i> it is recorded, that
on the fifth of April 1531, "one Richard
Rose, a cook, was boiled in Smithfield
for poisoning of divers persons,
to the number of sixteen or more."
Two only of the sixteen died, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
others were never restored to health.
If any thing could reconcile us to
torture, as a punishment to be inflicted
by man on his offending brother,
it is such a crime as this.</p>

<p>If the punishments of our ancestors
were cruel, if trials were sometimes
over hasty, and small offences
often too severely chastised, on the
other hand, culprits formerly had facilities
of escape now refused to them.
The right of sanctuary was enjoyed
by various districts and buildings in
London. Pennant and many other
writers have stigmatised this practice
as absurd; Mr Smith defends it upon
very reasonable grounds. "In times
when every man went armed, when
feuds were of hourly occurrence in
the streets, when the age had not yet
learned the true superiority of right
over might, and when private revenge
too often usurped the functions
of justice, it was essential that there
should be places whither the homicide
might flee, and find refuge and
protection until the violence of angry
passions had subsided, and there was
a chance of a fair trial for him." Not
all sanctuaries, however, gave protection
to the murderer, at least in
later times. Whitefriars, for instance,
once a refuge for all criminals, except
traitors, afforded shelter, after the
fifteenth century, to debtors only. In
1697 this sanctuary was abolished
entirely, at the same time with a
dozen others. It is not well ascertained
how it acquired the slang name
of Alsatia, which is first found in
a play of Shadwell's, <i>The Squire of
Alsatia</i>. Immortalised by the genius
of Scott, no sanctuary will longer
be remembered than Whitefriars. It
was one of the largest; many others
of the privileged districts being limited
to a court or alley, a few houses or a
church. Thus Ram Alley and Mitre
Court in Fleet Street, and Baldwin's
Gardens in Gray's Inn Lane, were
amongst these refugees of roguery and
crime. Whitefriars was much resorted
to by poets and players, dancing
and fencing masters, and persons of
the like vagabond and uncertain professions.
The poets and players were
attracted by the vicinity of the theatre
in Dorset Gardens, built after the fire
of London, by Sir Christopher Wren,
upon the site of Dorset House, the
residence of the Sackvilles. Here Sir
William Davenant's company of comedians&mdash;the
Duke of York's servants,
as they were called&mdash;performed for a
considerable time. It appears, however,
that even before the great fire,
there was a theatre in that neighbourhood.
Malone, in his <i>Prologomena</i>
to Shakspeare, quotes a memorandum
from the manuscript book
of Sir Henry Herbert, master of the
revels to King Charles I. It runs
thus:&mdash;"I committed Cromes, a broker
in Long Lane, the 16th of February
1634, to the Marshalsey, for lending
a church robe with the name of
Jesus upon it <i>to the players in Salisbury
Court</i>, to represent a Flamen, a
priest of the heathens. Upon his petition
of submission and acknowledgement
of his faults, I released him the
17th of February 1634."</p>

<p>The ancient sanctuary at Westminster
is of historical and Shaksperian
celebrity, as the place where
Elizabeth Grey, Queen of Edward the
Fourth, took refuge, when Warwick
the king-maker marched to London to
dethrone her husband, and set Henry
the Sixth on the throne. It was a
stone church, built in the form of a
cross, and so strongly, that its demolition,
in 1750, was a matter of great
difficulty. The precinct of St Martin's-le-Grand
was also sanctuary. Many
curious particulars respecting it are
to be found in Kempe's <i>Historical
Notices of the Collegiate Church, or
Royal Free Chapel and Sanctuary of
St Martin's-le-Grand, London</i>, published
in 1825. In the reign of Henry
the Fifth, this right of sanctuary gave
rise to a great dispute between the
Dean of St Martin's and the city
authorities. "A soldier, confined in
Newgate, was on his way to Guildhall,
in charge of an officer of the city,
when on passing the south gate of St
Martin's, opposite to Newgate Street,
five of his comrades rushed out of
Panyer Alley, with daggers drawn,
rescued him, and fled with him to the
holy ground." The sheriff had the
sanctuary forced, and sent rescued
and rescuers to Newgate. The Dean
of St Martin's, indignant at this violation
of privilege, complained to the
king, who ordered the prisoners to be
liberated. Thereat the citizens, ever
sticklers for their rights, demurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
and at last it was made a Star-Chamber
matter. The dean pleaded his
own cause, and that right skilfully
and wittily. He denied that the chapel
of St Martin's formed any part of the
city of London, as claimed by the
corporation; quoted a statute of Edward
III. constituting St Martin's
and Westminster Abbey places of
privilege for treason, felony, and debt;
and mentioned the curious fact, that
"when the King's justices held their
sittings in St Martin's Gate, for the
trial of prisoners for treason or felony,
the accused were placed before them,
<i>on the other side of the street</i>, and carefully
guarded from advancing forward;
for if they ever passed the water-channel
which divided the middle of
the street, they might claim the saving
franchise of the sacred precinct,
and the proceedings against them
would be immediately annulled." The
dean also expressed his wonder that
the citizens of London should be the
men to impugn his church's liberties,
since more than three hundred worshipful
members of the corporation
had within a few years been glad to
claim its privilege. The Star-Chamber
decided against the city, and the
prisoners were restored to sanctuary.
The Savoy was another sanctuary;
and it was the custom of the inhabitants
to tar and feather those who
ventured to follow their debtors thither.</p>

<p>In the theatrical district of London,
Mr Smith lingers long and fondly; for
there each house, almost every brick,
is rich in reminiscences, not only of
players and playhouses, but of wits,
poets, and artists. In the burial-ground
of St Paul's, Covent-Garden,
repose not a few of those who in their
lifetime inhabited or frequented the
neighbourhood. There lies the author
of Hudibras. "Mr Longueville, of
the Temple, Butler's steady friend,
and who mainly supported him in his
latter days, when the ungrateful Stuart
upon the throne, whose cause he
had so greatly served, had deserted
him, was anxious to have buried the
poet in Westminster Abbey. He
solicited for that purpose the contributions
of those wealthy persons, his
friends, whom he had heard speak
admiringly of Butler's genius, and
respectfully of his character, but none
would contribute, although he offered
to head the list with a considerable
sum." So poor Butler was buried in
Covent-Garden, privately but decently.
He is in good company. Sir
Peter Lely, the painter of dames, the
man who seemed created on purpose
to limn the languishing and voluptuous
beauties of Charles the Second's
court, is also buried in St Paul's; as
are also Wycherley and Southerne,
the dramatists; Haines and Macklin,
the comedians; Arne, the musician;
Strange, the engraver; and Walcot,
<i>alias</i> Peter Pindar. Sir Peter Lely
lived in Covent-Garden, in very great
style. "The original name of the
family was Vandervaes; but Sir Peter's
father, a gallant fellow, and an officer
in the army, having been born at a
perfumer's shop, the sign of the Lily,
was commonly known by the name of
Captain Lily, a name which his son
thought to be more euphonious to
English ears than Vandervaes, and
which he retained when he settled
here, slightly altering the spelling."
Wycherley, a dandy and a courtier,
as well as an author, had lodgings in
Bow Street, where Charles II. once
visited him when he was ill, and gave
him five hundred pounds to go a journey
to the south of France for the benefit
of his health. When he afterwards
married the Countess of Drogheda,
a young, rich, and beautiful
widow, she went to live with him in
Bow Street. She was very jealous,
and when he went over to the "Cock"
tavern, opposite to his house, he was
obliged to make the drawer open the
windows, that his lady might see there
was no woman in the company. This
"Cock" tavern was the great resort
of the rakes and mohocks of that day;
of Buckhurst, Sedley, Killigrew, and
others of the same kidney. In fact,
Bow Street was then the Bond Street
of London; and the "Cock," its
"Long's" or "Clarendon." Dryden,
in an epilogue, talks of the "Bow
Street beaux," and several contemporary
writers have similar allusions.
Like most places where the rich congregate,
this fashionable quarter was
a fine field for the ingenuity of pick-pockets,
and especially of wig and
sword-stealers, a class of thieves that
appeared with full-bottomed periwigs
and silver-hilted rapiers. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
those days, to keep a man's head decently
covered, cost nearly as much
as it now does to fill his belly and
clothe his back. Wigs were sometimes
of the value of forty or fifty
pounds. Ten or fifteen pounds was
an exceeding "low figure" for these
modish incumbrances. Out of respect
to such costly head-dress, hats were
never put on, but carried under the
arm. The wig-stealers could demand
no more. Mr Smith quotes a passage
from Gay, describing their man&oelig;uvres:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nor is thy flaxen wig with safety worn:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">High on the shoulder, in a basket borne,<br /></span>

<p>Will's coffeehouse was in Bow Street,
and "being the grand resort of wits
and critics, it is not surprising," says
Mr Smith, "that it should become
also the headquarters of envy, slander,
and detraction." There was then
a lack of printed vehicles for the
venting of the evil passions of rival
<i>literati</i>; lampoons were circulated in
manuscript, and read at Will's. As
the acknowledgment of the authorship
might sometimes have had disagreeable
consequences for the author,
a fellow of the name of Julian, who
styled himself "Secretary to the
Muses," became the mouthpiece of
libeller and satirist. He read aloud
in the coffee-room the pasquinades
that were brought to him, and distributed
written copies to all who desired
them. Concerning this base fellow,
Sir Walter Scott gives some curious
particulars in his edition of Dryden's
works. There is no record of cudgelings
bestowed upon Julian, though it
is presumed that he did not escape
them. "He is described," says Malone,
"as a very drunken fellow, and
at one time was confined for a libel."
Dryden was a great sufferer from
these violent and slanderous attacks&mdash;a
sufferer, indeed, in more senses than
one; for, besides being himself made
the subject of venomous lampoons, he
was suspected unjustly of having
written one, and was waylaid and
beaten on his way from Will's to his
house in Gerrard Street. A reward
of fifty pounds was offered for the
apprehension of his assailants, but
they remained undiscovered. Lord
Rochester was their employer: Lord
Mulgrave the real author of the libel.</p>

<p>In James Street, Covent-Garden,
where Garrick lodged, there resided,
from 1714 to 1720, a mysterious lady,
who excited great interest and curiosity.
Malcolm, in his <i>Anecdotes of
London during the Eighteenth Century</i>,
gives some account of her. She was
middle-sized, dark-haired, beautiful
and accomplished, and apparently
between thirty and forty years old.
She was wealthy, and possessed very
valuable jewels. Her death was sudden,
and occurred after a masquerade,
where she said she had conversed
with the King. It was remembered
that she had been seen in the private
apartments of Queen Anne; but after
that Queen's death, she lived in obscurity.
"She frequently said that
her father was a nobleman, but that,
her elder brother dying unmarried,
the title was extinct; adding, that
she had an uncle then living, whose
title was his least recommendation.
It seems likely enough that she was
connected in some way with the
Stuart family, and with their pretensions
to the throne."</p>

<p>Dr Arne was born in King Street.
His father, an honest upholsterer, at
the sign of the "Two Crowns and
Cushions," is said to have been the
original of Murphy's farce of <i>The
Upholsterer</i>. He did not countenance
his son's musical propensities; and
young Arne had to get up in the
night, and practise by stealth on a
muffled spinet. The first intimation
received by the worthy mattress-maker
of his son's proficiency in music,
was one evening at a concert, where
he quite unexpectedly saw him officiating
as leader of the orchestra.</p>

<p>Voltaire, when in England, after
his release from the Bastille, whither
he had been sent for libel, lodged in
Maiden Lane, at the White Peruke,
a wigmaker's shop. When walking
out, he was often annoyed by the
mob, who beheld, in his spare person,
polite manners, and satirical countenance,
the personification of their
notion of a Frenchman. "One day
he was beset by so great a crowd
that he was forced to shelter himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
against a doorway, where, mounting
the steps, he made a flaming speech
in English in praise of the magnanimity
of the English nation, and their
love of freedom. With this the people
were so delighted, that their jeers were
turned into applauses, and he was carried
in triumph to Maiden Lane on
the shoulders of the mob." From
which temporary elevation the arch-scoffer
doubtless looked down upon
his dupes with glee, suppressed, but
immeasurable.</p>

<p>Quitting the abodes of wit and the
drama for those of legal learning, we
pass from Covent-Garden to Lincoln's
Inn Fields, through Great Queen
Street, in the Stuarts' day one of the
most fashionable in London. Here
dwelt Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and
here he wrote the greater part of his
treatise <i>De Veritate</i>, concerning the
publication of which he believed himself,
according to his own marvellous
account, to have had a special revelation
from heaven. A strange weakness,
or rather madness, on the part
of a man who disbelieved, or at least
doubted, of general revelation. For
himself, he thought an exception possible.
Insanity alone could explain
and excuse such illogical vanity. Near
to this singular enthusiast lived Sir
Godfrey Kneller, whose next-door
neighbour and friend was Radcliffe
the physician. "Kneller," says Horace
Walpole, in his Anecdotes of
Painting, "was fond of flowers, and
had a fine collection. As there was
great intimacy between him and the
physician, he permitted the latter to
have a door into his gardens; but
Radcliffe's servants gathering and
destroying the flowers, Kneller sent
him word he must shut up the door.
Radcliffe replied peevishly, "Tell him
he may do any thing with it but paint
it." "And I," answered Godfrey,
"can take any thing from him but his
physic." Pope and Gay were frequent
visitors at the painter's studio. At
the wall of Lincoln's Inn Garden,
Ben Jonson is by some asserted to
have laboured as a bricklayer. "He
helped," says Fuller, "in the building
of the new structure of Lincoln's
Inn, where, having a trowel in his
hand, he had a book in his pocket."
Aubrey tells the same story, which is
discredited by Mr Gifford, who denies
that the poet ever was a bricklayer.
Lord William Russell was executed
in Lincoln's Inn Fields, it being, Pennant
tells us, the nearest open space
from Newgate, where he was confined.</p>

<p>Passing through Duke Street, where
Benjamin Franklin lodged, when working
as a journeyman printer in the adjacent
Great Wyld Street, into Clare
Market, the scene of Orator Henley's
holdings-forth, we thence, by Drury-Lane,
the residence of Nell Gwynne
and Nan Clarges before they became
respectively the King's mistress and a
Duke's wife, get back to the Strand and
move Citywards. But to refer, although
merely nominally, to one half the subjects
of interest met with on the way,
and suggested by Mr Smith, would
be to write an index, not a review.
Here, therefore, we pause, believing
that enough has been said to convince
the reader of the vast amount
of information and amusement derivable
from the bricks and stones of
London, and able to recommend to
him, should he himself set out on a
street pilgrimage, an excellent guide
and companion in the <i>Antiquarian
Ramble</i>.</p>

<h2>MARLBOROUGH'S DISPATCHES.</h2>

<h3>1711-1712.</h3>


<p>After the reduction of Bouchain,
Marlborough was anxious to commence
without delay the siege of
Quesnoy, the capture of which would,
in that quarter, have entirely broken
through the French barrier. He vigorously
stimulated his own government
accordingly, as well as that at
the Hague, to prepare the necessary
supplies and magazines, and expressed
a sanguine hope that the capture
of this last stronghold would be the
means of bringing about the grand
object of his ambition, and a general
peace.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The ministry, to appearance,
went with alacrity into his projects,
and every thing bore the aspect of
another great success closing the
campaign with honour, and probably
leading to a glorious and lasting
peace. Mr Secretary St John, in particular,
wrote in the warmest style of
cordiality, approving the project in
his own name as well as in that of
the Queen, and reiterating the assurances
that the strongest representations
had been made to the Dutch,
with a view to their hearty concurrence.
But all this was a mere cover
to conceal what the Tories had really
been doing to overturn Marlborough,
and abandon the main objects of the
war. Unknown to him, the secret negotiation
with the French Cabinet,
through Torcy and the British ministers,
through the agency of Mesnager,
had been making rapid progress.
No representations were made
to the Dutch, who were fully in the
secret of the pending negotiation,
about providing supplies; and on the
27th September, preliminaries of
peace, on the basis of the seven
articles proposed by Louis, were
signed by Mesnager on the part of
France, and by the two English secretaries
of state, in virtue of a special
warrant from the Queen.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The conditions of these preliminaries,
which were afterwards embodied
in the Treaty of Utrecht, were the
acknowledgement of the Queen's title
to the throne, and the Protestant
succession, by Louis; an engagement
to take all just and reasonable measures
that the crowns of France and
Spain should never be united on the
same head,&mdash;the providing a sufficient
barrier to the Dutch, the empire, and
the house of Austria; and the demolition
of Dunkirk, or a proper equivalent.
But the crown of Spain was
left to the Duke of Anjou, and no
provision whatever made to exclude
a Bourbon prince from succeeding to
it. Thus the main object of the contest&mdash;the
excluding the Bourbon family
from the throne of Spain, was
abandoned: and at the close of the
most important, successful, and glorious
war ever waged by England,
terms were agreed to, which left to
France advantages which could scarcely
have been hoped by the Cabinet of
Versailles as the fruit of a long series
of victories.</p>

<p>Marlborough felt deeply this clandestine
negotiation, which not only
deprived him of the main object for
which, during his great career, he had
been contending, but evinced a duplicity
and want of confidence on the
part of his own government at its
close, which was a melancholy return
for such inappreciable public services.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But it was of no avail; the secession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
of England proved, as he had foreseen
from the outset, a deathblow to the
confederacy. Finding that nothing
more was to be done, either at the
head of the army, or in direction of
the negotiations, he returned home by
the Brille, after putting his army into
winter-quarters, and landed at Greenwich
on the 17th November. Though
well aware of the private envy, as well
as political hostility of which he was
the object, he did nothing that could
lower or compromise his high character
and lofty position; but in an
interview with the Queen, fully expressed
his opinion on the impolicy of
the course which ministers were now
adopting.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He adopted the same
manly course in the noble speech which
he made in his place in Parliament, in
the debate on the address. Ministers
had put into the royal speech the unworthy
expression&mdash;"I am glad to
tell you, that notwithstanding <i>the arts
of those who delight in war</i>, both place
and time are appointed for opening the
treaty of a general peace." Lord Anglesea
followed this up, by declaring,
in the course of the debate, that the
country might have enjoyed the blessing
of peace soon after the battle of
Ramilies, if it had not been deferred
by some person whose interest it was
to prolong the war.</p>

<p>Rising upon this, with inexpressible
dignity, and turning to where the
Queen sat, Marlborough said, "I appeal
to the Queen, whether I did not
constantly, while I was plenipotentiary,
give her Majesty and her Council
an account of all the propositions
which were made; and whether I did
not desire instruction for my conduct
on this subject. I can declare with a
good conscience, in the presence of her
Majesty, of this illustrious assembly,
and of God himself, who is infinitely
superior to all the powers of the earth,
and before whom, by the ordinary
course of nature, I shall soon appear
to render account of my actions, that
I was very desirous of a safe, honourable,
and lasting peace, and was very
far from wishing to prolong the war
for my own private advantage, as
several libels and discourses have most
falsely insinuated. My great age, and
my numerous fatigues in war, make
me ardently wish for the power to enjoy
a quiet repose, in order to think of
eternity. As to other matters, I have
not the least inducement, on any account,
to desire the continuance of the
war for my own interest, since my
services have been so generously rewarded
by her Majesty and her parliament;
but I think myself obliged to
make such an acknowledgment to her
Majesty and my country, that I am
always ready to serve them, whenever
my duty may require, to obtain an
honourable and lasting peace. Yet I
can by no means acquiesce in the
measures that have been taken to enter
into a negotiation of peace with
France, upon the foot of some pretended
preliminaries, which are now
circulated; since my opinion is the
same as that of most of the Allies,
that <i>to leave Spain and the West Indies
to the House of Bourbon, will be
the entire ruin of Europe</i>, which I have
with all fidelity and humility declared
to her Majesty, when I had the honour
to wait upon her after my arrival
from Holland."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>This manly declaration, delivered
in the most emphatic manner, produced
a great impression; and a resolution
against ministers was carried
in the House of Peers by a majority
of twelve. In the Commons, however,
they had large majority, and
an address containing expressions
similar to those used by Lord Anglesea,
reflecting on Marlborough, was
introduced and carried there. The
Whig majority, however, continued
firm in the Upper House; and the
leaders of that party began to entertain
sanguine hopes of success. The
Queen had let fall some peevish expressions
in regard to her ministers.
She had given her hand, in retiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
from the House of Peers on the 15th
December, to the Duke of Somerset,
instead of her own Lord Treasurer;
it was apprehended her old partiality
for Marlborough was about to return;
Mrs Masham was in the greatest
alarm; and St John declared to Swift
that the Queen was false.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The
ministers of the whole alliance seconded
the efforts of the Whigs, and strongly
represented the injurious effects
which would ensue to the cause of
European independence in general,
and the interests of England in particular,
if the preliminaries which had
been agreed to should be made the
basis of a general peace. The Dutch
made strong and repeated representations
on the subject; and the Elector
of Hanover delivered a memorial
strongly urging the danger which
would ensue if Spain and the Indies
were allowed to remain in the hands
of a Bourbon prince.</p>

<p>Deeming themselves pushed to
extremities, and having failed in all
attempts to detach Marlborough from
the Whigs, Bolingbroke and the ministers
resolved on the desperate measure
of bringing forward the accusation
against him, of fraud and peculation
in the management of the public
monies entrusted to his management
in the Flemish campaign. The charges
were founded on the report of certain
commissioners to whom the matter
had been remitted; and which charged
the Duke with having appropriated
L.63,319 of the public monies destined
for the use of the English troops, and
L.282,366, as a per-centage of two
per cent on the sum paid to foreign
ambassadors during the ten years of
the war. In reply to these abominable
insinuations, the letter of the Duke
to the commissioners was published
on the 27th December, in which he
entirely refuted the charges, and
showed that he had never received
any sums or perquisites, not sanctioned
by previous and uniform usage,
and far less than had been received by
the general in the reign of William III.
And in regard to the L.282,000 of per-centage
on foreign subsidies, this was
proved to have been a voluntary gift
from those powers to the English
general, authorised by their signatures
and sanctioned by warrants from the
Queen. This answer made a great
impression; but ministers had gone
too far to retreat, and they ventured
on a step which, for the honour of the
country, has never, even in the worst
times, been since repeated. Trusting
to their majority in the Commons,
they dismissed the Duke from all his
situations on the 31st December; and
in order to stifle the voice of justice
in the Upper House, on the following
day patents were issued calling <i>twelve</i>
new peers to the Upper House. On
the following day they were introduced
amidst the groans of the House:
the Whig noblemen, says a contemporary
annalist, "cast their eyes on
the ground as if they had been invited
to the funeral of the peerage."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Unbounded was the joy diffused
among the enemies of England by
these unparalleled measures. On
hearing of Marlborough's fall, Louis
XIV. said with triumph, "The dismission
of Marlborough will do all we
can desire." The Court of St Germains
was in exultation; and the
general joy of the Jacobites, both at
home and abroad, was sufficient to
demonstrate how formidable an enemy
to their cause they regarded the
Duke; and how destitute of truth were
the attempts to show that he had
been engaged in a secret design to
restore the exiled family. Marlborough
disdained to make any defence
of himself in Parliament; but
an able answer on his part was prepared
and circulated, which entirely
refuted the whole charges against the
illustrious general. So convinced were
ministers of this, that, contenting
themselves with resolutions against
him in the House of Commons, where
their influence was predominant, they
declined to prefer any impeachment
or accusation, even in the Upper
House swamped by their recent creations.
In the midst of this disgraceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
scene of passion, envy, and ingratitude,
Prince Eugene arrived in London
to endeavour to stem the torrent
and, if possible, prevent the secession
of England from the confederacy.
He was lodged with the Lord Treasurer;
and the generous prince omitted
no opportunity of testifying his
undiminished respect for his illustrious
rival in the day of his tribulation. The
Treasurer having said to him at a
great dinner, "I consider this day as
the happiest of my life, since I have
the honour to see in my house the
greatest captain of the age." "If it be
so," replied Eugene, "I owe it to
your lordship;" alluding to his dismissal
of Marlborough. On another
occasion, some one having pointed out
a passage in one of the libels against
Marlborough, in which he was said
to have been "perhaps once fortunate."
"It is true," said Eugene;
"he was <i>once</i> fortunate; and it is the
greatest praise which can be bestowed
on him; for, as he was <i>always</i> successful&mdash;that
implies that all his other
successes were owing to his own conduct."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Alarmed at the weight which
Marlborough might derive from the
presence and support of so great a
commander, and the natural sympathy
of all generous minds with the cordial
admiration which these two great men
entertained for each other, the ministers
had recourse to a pretended conspiracy,
which it was alleged had been discovered
on the part of Marlborough and
Eugene to seize the government and dethrone
the Queen, on the 17th November.
St John and Oxford had too much
sense to publish such a ridiculous
statement; but it was made the subject
of several secret examinations
before the Privy Council, in order to
augment the apprehensions and secure
the concurrence of the Queen in their
measures. Such as it was, the tale was
treated as a mere malicious invention,
even by the contemporary foreign annalists,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
though it has since been repeated
as true by more than one party
native historian.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This ridiculous calumny,
and the atrocious libels as to the
embezzlement of the public money,
however, produced the desired effect.
They inflamed the mind of the Queen,
and removed that vacillation in regard
to the measures of government, from
which so much danger was apprehended
by the Tory administration.
Having answered the desired end, they
were allowed quietly to go to sleep.
No proceedings in the House of Peers,
or elsewhere, followed the resolutions
of the Commons condemnatory
of Marlborough's financial administration
in the Low Countries. His
defence, published in the newspapers,
though abundantly vigorous, was neither
answered nor prosecuted as a
libel on the Commissioners or House of
Commons; and the alleged Stuart conspiracy
was never more heard of, till it
was long after drawn from its slumber
by the malice of English party spirit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the negotiations at
Utrecht for a general peace continued,
and St John and Oxford soon found
themselves embarrassed by the extravagant
pretensions which their
own conduct had revived in the
plenipotentiaries of Louis. So great
was the general indignation excited
by the publication of the preliminaries
at Utrecht, that St John felt the
necessity of discontinuing any general
negotiation, and converting it into a
private correspondence between the
plenipotentiaries of the English and
French crowns.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Great difficulty was
experienced in coming to an accommodation,
in consequence of the rising
demands of the French plenipotentiaries,
who, deeming themselves secure
of support from the English
ministry, not only positively refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
to abandon Spain and the Indies, but
now demanded the Netherlands for
the Elector of Bavaria, and the cession
of Lille and Tournay in return
for the seizure of Dunkirk. The sudden
death, however, first of the Dauphiness
of France, and then of the
Dauphin, the former of whom was
carried off by a malignant fever on
the 12th, the latter on the 18th February
1712, followed by the death of
their eldest son on the 23d, produced
feelings of commiseration for the aged
monarch, now in his seventy-third
year and broken down by misfortunes,
which rendered the progress of the
separate negotiation more easy. England
agreed to abandon its allies,
and the main object of the war, on
condition that a guarantee should be
obtained against the crowns of France
and Spain being united on the same
head. On this frail security, the
English ministry agreed to withdraw
their contingent from the Allied army;
and to induce the Dutch to follow
their example, Ipres was offered
to them on the same terms as Dunkirk
had been to Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The disastrous effects of this secret
and dishonourable secession, on the
part of England, from the confederacy,
were soon apparent. Great had been
the preparations of the continental
Allies for continuing the contest; and
while the English contingent remained
with them, their force was irresistible.
Prince Eugene was at the head of the
army in Flanders, and, including the
British forces under the Duke of Ormond,
it amounted to the immense
force of 122,000 effective men, with
120 guns, sixteen howitzers, and
an ample pontoon train. To oppose
this, by far the largest army he
had yet had to confront in the Low
Countries, Villars had scarcely at his
command 100,000 men, and they were
ill equipped, imperfectly supplied with
artillery, and grievously depressed in
spirit by their long series of disasters.
Eugene commanded the army of the
confederates; for although the English
ministry had been lavish in their
promises of unqualified support, the
Dutch had begun to entertain serious
suspicions of their sincerity, and bestowed
the command on that tried
officer instead of the Duke of Ormond,
who had succeeded Marlborough in
the command of the English contingent.
But Marlborough's soul still
directed the movements of the army;
and Eugene's plan of the campaign
was precisely that which that great
commander had chalked out at the
close of the preceding one. This was
to besiege Quesnoy and Landrecies,
<i>the last</i> of the iron barrier of France
which in this quarter protected the
frontier, and immediately after to
inundate the open country, and advance
as rapidly as possible to Paris.
It was calculated they might reach it
in <i>ten</i> marches from Landrecies; and
it was well known that there was
neither a defensible position nor fortress
of any sort to arrest the invaders'
march. The Court of Versailles were
in despair: the general opinion was,
that the King should leave Paris,
and retire to Blois; and although the
proud spirit of Louis recoiled at such
a proposal, yet, in taking leave
of Marshal Villars, he declared&mdash;"Should
a disaster occur, I will go
to Peronne or St Quentin, collect all
my troops, and with you risk a last
effort, determined to perish, or save
the State."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But the French monarch was spared
this last desperate alternative. The
defection of the British Cabinet saved
his throne, when all his means of
defence were exhausted. Eugene, on
opening the campaign on the 1st May,
anxiously inquired of the Duke of
Ormond whether he had authority to
act vigorously in the campaign, and
received an answer that he had the
same authority as the Duke of Marlborough,
and was prepared to join
in attacking the enemy. Preparations
were immediately made for forcing
the enemy's lines, which covered
Quesnoy, previous to an attack on
that fortress. But, at the very time
that this was going on, the work of
perfidious defection was consummated.
On May 10, Mr Secretary
St John sent positive orders to Ormond
to take no part in any general
engagement, as the questions at issue
between the contending parties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
on the point of adjustment.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Intimation
of this secret order was sent
to the Court of France, but it was
directed to be kept a positive secret
from the Allied generals. Ormond,
upon the receipt of these orders,
opened a private correspondence with
Villars, informing him that their
troops were no longer enemies, and
that the future movements of the
troops under his command were
only to get forage and provisions.
This correspondence was unknown
to Eugene; but circumstances soon
brought the defection of England to
light. In the middle of it, the Allied
forces had passed the Scheldt, and
taken post between Noyeller and the
Boiase, close to Villars's position. To
bring the sincerity of the English to
a test, Eugene proposed a general
attack on the enemy's line, which was
open and exposed, on the 28th May.
<i>But Ormond declined</i>, requesting the
operation might be delayed for a few
days. The defection was now apparent,
and the Dutch deputies loudly
condemned such dishonorable conduct;
but Eugene, anxious to make
the most of the presence of the British
troops, though their co-operation could
no longer be relied on, proposed to
besiege Quesnoy, which was laid open
by Villars's retreat. Ormond, who felt
acutely the painful and discreditable
situation in which, without any fault
of his own, he was placed, could not
refuse, and the investment took place
that very day. The operations were
conducted by <i>the Dutch and Imperial
troops alone</i>; and the town was taken,
after a siege of six weeks, on the 10th
July.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>This disgraceful defection on the
part of the English government excited,
as well it might, the utmost
indignation among the Allies, and
produced mingled feelings of shame
and mortification among all real patriots
or men of honour in this country.
By abandoning the contest in this
manner, when it was on the very
point of being crowned with success,
the English lost the fruit of TEN costly
and bloody campaigns, and suffered
the war to terminate without attaining
the main object for which it had
been undertaken. Louis XIV., defeated,
and all but ruined, was permitted
to retain for his grandson the
Spanish succession; and England,
victorious, and within sight, as it
were, of Paris, was content to halt in
the career of victory, and lost the
opportunity, never to be regained for
a century to come, of permanently
restraining the ambition of France.
It was the same as if, a few days after
the battle of Waterloo, England had
concluded a separate peace, guaranteeing
the throne of Spain to Joseph
Buonaparte, and providing only for
its not being held also by the Emperor
of France. Lord Halifax gave vent
to the general indignation of all generous
and patriotic men, when he said,
in the debate on the address, on 28th
May, after enumerating the proud
list of victories which, since the commencement
of the war, had attended
the arms of England,&mdash;"But all this
pleasing prospect is totally effaced by
the orders given to the Queen's general,
not to act offensively against the
enemy. I pity that heroic and gallant
general, who, on other occasions, took
delight to charge the most formidable
corps and strongest squadrons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
cannot but be uneasy at his being
fettered with shackles, and thereby
prevented from reaping the glory
which he might well expect from leading
on troops so long accustomed to
conquer. I pity the Allies, who have
relied upon the aid and friendship of
the British nation, perceiving that
what they had done at so great an
expense of blood and treasure is of
no effect, as they will be exposed to
the revenge of that power against
whom they have been so active. I
pity the Queen, her royal successors,
and the present and future generations
of Britain, when they shall find the
nation deeply involved in debt, and
that the common enemy who occasioned
it, though once near being
sufficiently humbled, does still triumph,
and design their ruin; and are informed
that this proceeds from the
conduct of the British cabinet, in neglecting
to make a right use of those
advantages and happy occasions which
their own courage and God's blessing
had put into their hands."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Marlborough seconded the motion
of Halifax, in a speech of peculiar
interest, as the last which he made
on the conduct of this eventful war.
"Although," said he, "the negotiations
for peace may be far advanced,
yet I can see no reason which
should induce the Allies or ourselves to
remain inactive, and not push on the
war with the utmost vigour, as we have
incurred the expense of recruiting the
army for the service of another year.
That army is now in the field; and
it has often occurred that a victory
or a siege produced good effects and
manifold advantages, when treaties
were still further advanced than in
the present negotiation. And as I
am of opinion that we should make
the most we can for ourselves, the
only infallible way to force France to
an entire submission, is to besiege and
occupy Cambray or Arras, and to
carry the war into the heart of the
kingdom. But as the troops of the
enemy are now encamped, it is impossible
to execute that design, unless
they are withdrawn from their position;
and as they cannot be reduced
to retire for want of provisions, they
must be attacked and forced. For
the truth of what I say I appeal to a
noble duke (Argyle) whom I rejoice
to see in this house, because he knows
the country, and is as good a judge of
these matters as any person now
alive." Argyle, though a bitter personal
enemy of Marlborough, thus
appealed to, said,&mdash;"I do indeed
know that country, and the situation
of the enemy in their present camp,
and I agree with the noble duke, that
it is impossible to remove them
without attacking and driving them
away; and, until that is effected,
neither of the two sieges alluded to
can be undertaken. I likewise agree
that the capture of these two towns
is the most effectual way to carry on
the war with advantage, and would
be a fatal blow to France."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the creation of
twelve peers to swamp the Upper
House, it is doubtful how the division
would have gone, had not Lord
Strafford, a cabinet minister, observed,
in reply to the charge, that the British
government was about to conclude a
separate peace,&mdash;"Nothing of that
nature has ever been intended; for
such a peace would be so <i>foolish, villanous,
and knavish</i>, that every servant
of the Queen must answer for it
with his head to the nation. The
Allies <i>are acquainted with our proceedings,
and satisfied with our terms</i>."
This statement was made by a British
minister, in his place in Parliament,
on the 28th May, eighteen days
<i>after</i> the private letter from Mr Secretary
St John to the Duke of Ormond,
already quoted, mentioning
the private treaty with Louis, enjoining
him to keep it secret from the
Allies, and communicate clandestinely
with Villars. But such a declaration,
coming from an accredited
minister of the crown, produced a
great impression, and ministers prevailed
by a majority of sixty-eight to
forty. In the course of the debate,
Earl Poulett let fall such cutting expressions
against Marlborough for
having, as he alleged, led his troops
to certain destruction, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
profit by the sale of the officers' commissions,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
that the Duke, without
deigning a reply, sent him a challenge
on leaving the house. The agitation,
however, of the Earl, who was less
cool than the iron veteran on the
prospect of such a meeting, revealed
what was going forward, and by an
order of the Queen, the affair was terminated
without bloodshed.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>It soon appeared how much foundation
there was for the assertion of the
Queen's ministers, that England was
engaged in no separate negotiation for a
peace. On the 6th June were promulgated
the outlines of the treaty which
afterwards became so famous as the
<span class="smcap">Peace of Utrecht</span>. The Duke of
Anjou was to renounce for ever, for
himself and his descendants, all claim
to the French crown; and the crown of
Spain was to descend, by <i>the male line</i>
only, to the Duke of Anjou, and failing
them to certain princes of the
Bourbon line by <i>male</i> descent, always
excluding him who was possessed of
the French crown.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Gibraltar and
Minorca remained to England; Dunkirk
was to be demolished; the Spanish
Netherlands were to be ceded to
Austria, with Naples, Milan, and
Sardinia; the barrier towns were to be
ceded to the Dutch, as required in
1709, with the exception of two or
three places. Spain and her Indian
colonies remained with the Duke of
Anjou and his male heirs, as King of
Spain. And thus, at the conclusion
of the most glorious and successful
war recorded in English history, did
the English cabinet leave to France
the great object of the contest,&mdash;the
crown of Spain, and its magnificent
Indian colonies, placed on the head of
a prince of the Bourbon race. With
truth did Marlborough observe, in the
debate on the preliminaries&mdash;"The
measures pursued in England for the
last year are directly contrary to her
Majesty's engagements with the Allies,
sully the triumphs and glories of her
reign, and will render the English
name odious to all other nations."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
It was all in vain. The people loudly
clamoured for peace; the Tory ministry
was seconded by a vast numerical
majority throughout the country. The
peace was approved of by large majorities
in both houses. Parliament
was soon after prorogued; and Marlborough,
seeing his public career terminated,
solicited and obtained passports
to go abroad, which he soon
afterwards did.</p>

<p>Great was the mourning, and loud
the lamentations, both in the British
and Allied troops, when the fatal day
arrived that the former were to
separate from their old companions in
arms. On the 10th July, the very
day on which Quesnoy surrendered,
the last of their long line of triumphs,
Ormond, having exhausted every sort
of procrastination to postpone the
dreaded hour, was compelled to order
the English troops to march. He in
vain, however, gave a similar order
to the auxiliaries in British pay; the
hereditary Prince of Cassel replied&mdash;"The
Hessians would gladly march, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
it were to fight the French." Another,
"We do not serve for pay, but fame."
The native British, however, were
compelled to obey the order of their
sovereign, and they set out, twelve
thousand strong, from the camp at
Cambresis. Of all the Germans in
British pay, only one battalion of
Holstein men, and a regiment of
dragoons from Liege, accompanied
them. Silent and dejected they took
their way; the men kept their eyes
on the ground, the officers did not
venture to return the parting salute
of the comrades who had so long
fought and conquered by their side.
Not a word was spoken on either
side, the hearts of all were too big
for utterance; but the averted eye,
the mournful air, the tear often trickling
down the cheek, told the deep
dejection which was every where felt.
It seemed as if the Allies were following
to the grave, with profound affection,
the whole body of their British
comrades. But when the troops
reached their resting-place for the
night, and the suspension of arms was
proclaimed at the head of each regiment,
the general indignation became
so vehement, that even the bonds of
military discipline were unable to restrain
it. A universal cry, succeeded
by a loud murmur, was heard through
the camp. The British soldiers were
seen tearing their hair, casting their
muskets on the ground, and rending
their clothes, uttering all the while
furious exclamations against the government
which had so shamefully
betrayed them. The officers were so
overwhelmed with vexation, that they
sat apart in their tents looking on the
ground, through very shame; and for
several days shrunk from the sight
even of their fellow-soldiers. Many
left their colours to serve with the
Allies, others withdrew, and whenever
they thought of Marlborough
and their days of glory, tears filled
their eyes.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It soon appeared that it was not
without reason that these gloomy presentiments
prevailed on both sides,
as to the consequences of the British
withdrawing from the contest. So
elated were the French by their secession,
that they speedily lost all
sense of gratitude and even honesty,
and refused to give up Dunkirk to
the British, which was only effected
with great difficulty on the earnest
entreaties of the British government.
So great were the difficulties which
beset the negotiation, that St John
was obliged to repair in person to
Paris, where he remained <i>incognito</i>
for a considerable time, and effected a
compromise of the objects still in dispute
between the parties. The secession
of England from the confederacy
was now openly announced; and, as
the Allies refused to abide by her preliminaries,
the separate negotiation
continued between the two countries,
and lingered on for nearly a year after
the suspension of arms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eugene, after the departure
of the British, continued his
operations, and laid siege to Landrecies,
the last of the barrier fortresses
on the road to Paris, in the end of
July. But it soon appeared that
England had been the soul of the
confederacy; and that it was the tutelary
arm of Marlborough which had
so long averted disaster, and chained
victory to its standard. Nothing but
defeat and misfortune attended the
Allies after her secession. Even the
great and tried abilities of Eugene
were inadequate to procure for them
one single success, after the colours of
England no longer waved in their
ranks. During the investment of
Landrecies, Villars drew together the
garrisons from the neighbouring towns,
no longer threatened by the English
troops, and surprised at Denain a
body of eight thousand men, stationed
there for the purpose of facilitating
the passage of convoys to the besieging
army. This disaster rendered it
necessary to raise the siege of Landrecies,
and Villars immediately resumed
the offensive. Douay was
speedily invested: a fruitless effort of
Eugene to retain it only exposed him
to the mortification of witnessing its
surrender. Not expecting so sudden
a reverse of fortune, the fortresses
recently taken were not provided
with provisions or ammunition, and
were in no condition to make any
effectual resistance. Quesnoy soon
fell from this cause; and Bouchain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
the last trophy of Marlborough's victories,
opened its gates on the 10th
October. The coalition was paralysed;
and Louis, who so lately
trembled for his capital, found his
armies advancing from conquest to
conquest, and tearing from the Allies
the fruits of all their victories.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>These disasters, and the evident
inability of the Allied armies, without
the aid of the English, to keep their
ground in Flanders, in a manner compelled
the Dutch, how unwilling soever,
to follow the example of Great
Britain, in treating separately with
France. They became parties, accordingly,
to the pacification at
Utrecht; and Savoy also concluded
peace there. But the barrier for
which they had so ardently contended
was, by the desertion of England, so
much reduced, that it ceased to afford
any effectual security against the encroachments
of France. That power
held the most important fortresses in
Flanders which had been conquered
by Louis XIV.&mdash;Cambray, Valenciennes,
and Arras. Lille, the conquest
on which Marlborough most
prided himself, was restored by the
Allies, and with it Bethune, Aire, St
Venant, and many other places. The
Dutch felt, in the strongest manner,
the evil consequences of a treaty
which thus, in a manner, left the enemy
at their gates; and the irritation
consequently produced against England
was so violent that it continued
through the greater part of the eighteenth
century. Austria, indignant at
being thus deserted by all her Allies,
continued the contest alone through
another campaign. But she was
overmatched in the contest; her resources
were exhausted; and, by the
advice of Eugene, conferences were
opened at Rastadt, from which, as a
just reward for her perfidy, England
was excluded. A treaty was soon
concluded on the basis of the Treaty
of Ryswick. It left Charles the Low
Countries, and all the Spanish territories
in Italy, except Sicily; but,
with Sardinia, Bavaria was restored.
France retained Landau, but restored
New Brisach, Fribourg, and Kehl.
Thus was that great power left in
possession of the whole conquests
ceded to Louis XIV. by the treaties
of Aix-la-Chapelle, Nimeguen, and
Ryswick, with the vast addition of
the family alliance with a Bourbon
prince, possessing Spain and the Indies.
A century of repeated wars on
the part of England and the European
powers, with France, followed by the
dreadful struggle of the Revolutionary
contest, and the costly campaigns of
Wellington, were the legacy bequeathed
to the nation by Bolingbroke
and Harley, in arresting the course of
Marlborough's victories, and restoring
France to preponderance, when it was
on the eve of being reduced to a level
consistent with the independence of
other states. Well might Mr Pitt
style the Treaty of Utrecht "the indelible
reproach of the age!"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Marlborough's public career was
now terminated; and the dissensions
which had cast him down from power
had so completely extinguished his
political influence, that during the remaining
years of his life, he rarely
appeared at all in public life. On
landing on the Continent, at Brille, on
the 24th November, he was received
with such demonstrations of gratitude
and respect, as showed how deeply
his public services had sunk into the
hearts of men, and how warmly they
appreciated his efforts to avert from
England and the Coalition, the evils
likely to flow from the Treaty of
Utrecht. At Maestricht he was
welcomed with the honours usually
reserved for sovereign princes; and
although he did his utmost, on the
journey to Aix-la-Chapelle, to avoid
attracting the public attention, and
to slip unobserved through byways,
yet the eagerness of the public,
or the gratitude of his old soldiers,
discovered him wherever he went.
Wherever he passed, crowds of
all ranks were waiting to see him,
could they only get a glimpse of the
hero who had saved the empire, and
filled the world with his renown. All
were struck with his noble air and
demeanour, softened, though not
weakened, by the approach of age.
They declared that his appearance
was not less conquering than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
sword. Many burst into tears when
they recollected what he had been,
and what he was, and how unaccountably
the great nation to which
he belonged had fallen from the height
of glory to such degradation. Yet
was the manner of Marlborough so
courteous and yet animated, his conversation
so simple and yet cheerful,
that it was commonly said at the
time, "that the only things he had
forgotten were his own deeds, and the
only things he remembered were the
misfortunes of others." Crowds of
all ranks, from the highest to the
lowest, hastened to attend his levee
at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 17th January
1713, and the Duke de Lesdeguières,
on leaving it, said, with equal
justice and felicity,&mdash;"I can now say
that I have seen the man who is equal
to the Maréchal de Turenne in conduct,
to the Prince of Condé in courage,
and superior to the Maréchal de
Luxembourg in success."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But if the veteran hero found some
compensation, in the unanimous admiration
of foreign nations, for the ingratitude
with which he had been
treated by the government of his own,
he was soon destined to find that
gratitude for past services was not to
be looked for among foreign nations
any more than his own countrymen.
Upon the restoration of the Elector,
by the treaty of Rastadt, the principality
of Mendleheim, which had been
bestowed upon Marlborough after the
battle of Blenheim by the Emperor
Joseph, was resumed by the Elector.
No stipulation in his favour was made
either by the British government or
the Imperial court, and therefore the
estate, which yielded a clear revenue
of £2000 a-year, was lost to Marlborough.
He transmitted, through
Prince Eugene, a memorial to the
Emperor, claiming an indemnity for
his loss; but though it was earnestly
supported by that generous prince,
yet being unaided by any efforts on
the part of the English ministry, it
was allowed to fall asleep. An indemnity
was often promised, even by
the Emperor in writing,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> but performance
of the promise was always
evaded. The Duke was made a prince
of the Holy Roman Empire, but obtained
nothing but empty honours for
his services; and at this moment, these
high-sounding titles are all that remain
in the Marlborough family to
testify the gratitude of the Cæsars to
the hero who saved their Imperial
and Royal thrones.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The same oblivion of past and inappreciable
services, when they were
no longer required, pursued the illustrious
general in his declining years,
on the part of his own countrymen.
The got-up stories about embezzlement
and dilapidation of the public
money, in Flanders, were allowed to
go to sleep, when they had answered
their destined purpose of bringing
about his fall from political power.
No grounds were found for a prosecution
which could afford a chance
of success, even in the swamped and
now subservient House of Peers. But
every thing that malice could suggest,
or party bitterness effect, was done to
fill the last days of the immortal hero
with anxiety and disquiet. Additional
charges were brought against
him by the commissioners, founded
on the allegation that he had drawn
a pistole per troop, and ten shillings
a company, for mustering the soldiers,
though, in the foreign auxiliaries, it
was often not done. Marlborough at
once transmitted a refutation of those
fresh charges, so clear and decisive,
that it entirely silenced those accusations.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
But his enemies, though
driven from this ground, still persecuted
him with unrelenting malice.
The noble pile of Blenheim, standing,
as it did, an enduring monument at
once of the Duke's services and the
nation's gratitude, was a grievous
eyesore to the dominant majority in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
England, and they did all in their
power to prevent its completion.</p>

<p>Orders were first given to the Treasury,
on June 1, 1712, to suspend
any further payments from the royal
exchequer; and commissioners were
appointed to investigate the claims of
the creditors and expense of the work.
They recommended the payment of a
third to each claimant, which was
accordingly made; but as many years
elapsed, and no further payments to
account were made, the principal creditors
brought an action in the Court of
Exchequer against the Duke, as personally
liable for the amount, and the
court pronounced decree in favour of
the plaintiffs, which was affirmed,
after a long litigation, in the House
of Lords. Meanwhile the works, for
want of any paymaster, were at a
stand; and this noble pile, this proud
monument of a nation's gratitude,
would have remained a modern ruin
to this day, had it not been completed
from the private funds of the hero
whose services it was intended to
commemorate. But the Duke of
Marlborough, as well as the Duchess,
were too much interested in the work
to allow it to remain unfinished. He
left by his will fifty thousand pounds
to complete the building, which was
still in very unfinished state at the
time of his death, and the duty was
faithfully performed by the Duchess
after his decease. From the accounts
of the total expense, preserved at
Blenheim, it appears, that out of three
hundred thousand pounds, which the
whole edifice cost, no less than sixty
thousand pounds was provided from
the private funds of the Duke of
Marlborough.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>It may readily be believed that
so long-continued and unrelenting a
persecution of so great a man and
distinguished benefactor of his country,
proceeded from something more
than mere envy at greatness, powerful
as that principle ever is in little
minds. In truth, it was part of the
deep-laid plan for the restoration of the
Stuart line, which the declining state
of the Queen's health, and the probable
unpopularity of the Hanover family,
now revived in greater vigour than ever.
During this critical period, Marlborough,
who was still on the Continent,
remained perfectly firm to the
Act of Settlement, and the Protestant
cause. Convinced that England was
threatened with a counter-revolution,
he used his endeavours to secure the
fidelity of the garrison of Dunkirk,
and offered to embark at its head in
support of the Protestant succession.
He sent General Cadogan to make
the necessary arrangements with
General Stanhope for transporting
troops to England, to support the
Hanoverian succession, and offered to
lend the Elector of Hanover £20,000
to aid him in his endeavour to secure
the succession. So sensible was the
Electoral house of the magnitude of
his services, and his zeal in their behalf,
that the Electress Sophia entrusted
him with a blank warrant,
appointing him commander-in-chief
of her troops and garrisons, on her accession

<p>On the death of Queen Anne, on
August 1, 1714, Marlborough returned
to England, and was soon after appointed
captain-general and master-general
of the ordnance. Bolingbroke
and Oxford were shortly after
impeached, and the former then
threw off the mask, by flying to
France, where he openly entered into
the service of the Pretender at St
Germains. Marlborough's great popularity
with the army was soon after
the means of enabling him to appease
a mutiny in the guards, which at first
threatened to be alarming. During
the rebellion in 1715, he directed, in a
great degree, the operations against
the rebels, though he did not actually
take the field; and to his exertions,
its rapid suppression was in a great
measure to be ascribed.</p>

<p>But the period had now arrived
when the usual fate of mortality
awaited this illustrious man. Severe
domestic bereavements preceded his
dissolution, and in a manner weaned
him from a world which he had passed
through with so much glory. His
daughter, Lady Bridgewater, died in
March 1714; and this was soon followed
by the death of his favourite
daughter, Anne Countess of Sunderland,
who united uncommon elegance
and beauty to unaffected piety and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">[702]</a></span>
exemplary virtue. Marlborough himself
was not long of following his
beloved relatives to the grave. On
the 28th May 1716, he was seized
with a fit of palsy, so severe that it
deprived him, for a time, alike of speech
and recollection. He recovered, however,
to a certain degree, and went to
Bath, for the benefit of the waters;
and a gleam of returning light shone
upon his mind when he visited Blenheim
on the 18th October. He expressed
great satisfaction at the survey
of the plan; which reminded him
of his great achievements; but when
he saw, in one of the few rooms
which were finished, a picture of
himself at the battle of Blenheim,
he turned away with a mournful
air, with the words&mdash;"Something
then, but now&mdash;&mdash;" On November
18th he was attacked by another
stroke, more severe than the former,
and his family hastened to pay the
last duties, as they conceived, to their
departing parent. The strength of
his constitution, however, triumphed
for a time even over this violent attack;
but though he continued contrary
to his own wishes, in conformity
with those of his friends, who needed
the support of his great reputation, to
hold office, and occasionally appeared
in parliament, yet his public
career was at an end. A considerable
addition was made to his fortune by
the sagacity of the Duchess, who persuaded
him to embark part of his
funds in the South Sea scheme; and
foreseeing the crash which was approaching,
sold out so opportunely,
that, instead of losing, she gained
£100,000 by the transaction. On
the 27th November 1721, he made
his last appearance in the House of
Lords; but in June 1722, he was
again attacked with paralysis so violently,
that he lay for some days
nearly motionless, though in perfect
possession of his faculties. To a
question from the Duchess, whether
he heard the prayers read as usual
at night, on the 15th June, in his
apartment; he replied, "Yes; and
I joined in them." These were his
last words. On the morning of the
16th he sunk rapidly, and, at four
o'clock, calmly breathed his last, in
the 72d year of his age.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Envy is generally extinguished by
death, because the object of it has
ceased to stand in the way of those
who feel it. Marlborough's funeral
obsequies were celebrated with uncommon
magnificence, and all ranks
and parties joined in doing him honour.
His body lay in state for several
days at Marlborough House, and
crowds flocked together from all the
three kingdoms to witness the imposing
ceremony of his funeral, which
was performed with the utmost magnificence,
on the 28th June. The procession
was opened by a long array
of military, among whom were General,
now Lord Cadogan, and many
other officers who had suffered and
bled in his cause. Long files of heralds,
officers-at-arms, and pursuivants
followed, bearing banners emblazoned
with his armorial achievements,
among which appeared, in uncommon
lustre, the standard of Woodstock,
exhibiting the arms of France on the
Cross of St George. In the centre of
the cavalcade was a lofty car, drawn
by eight horses, which bore the mortal
remains of the Hero, under a
splendid canopy adorned by plumes,
military trophies, and heraldic devices
of conquest. Shields were affixed to
the sides, bearing the names of the
towns he had taken, and the fields
he had won. Blenheim was there,
and Oudenarde, Ramilies and Malplaquet;
Lille and Tournay; Bethune,
Douay, and Ruremonde; Bouchain
and Mons, Maestricht and Ghent.
This array of names made the English
blush for the manner in which
they had treated their hero. On
either side were five generals in military
mourning, bearing aloft banderoles,
on which were emblazoned
the arms of the family. Eight
dukes supported the pall; besides
the relatives of the deceased, the
noblest and proudest of England's
nobility joined in the procession. Yet
the most moving part of the ceremony
was the number of old soldiers who
had combated with the hero on his
fields of fame, and who might now be
known, in the dense crowds which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
thronged the streets, by their uncovered
heads, grey hairs, and the
tears which trickled down their
cheeks. The body was deposited,
with great solemnity, in Westminster
Abbey, at the east end of the tomb
of Henry VII.; but this was not its
final resting-place in this world. It
was soon after removed to the chapel
at Blenheim, where it was deposited
in a magnificent mausoleum; and
there it still remains, surmounted by
the noble pile which the genius of
Vanbrugh had conceived to express a
nation's gratitude.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The extraordinary merit of Marlborough's
military talents will not be
duly appreciated, unless the peculiar
nature of the contest he was called on
to direct, and the character which he
assumed in his time, is taken into
consideration.</p>

<p>The feudal times had ceased&mdash;at
least so far as the raising of a military
force by its machinery was concerned.
Louis XIV., indeed, when pressed for
men, more than once summoned the
ban and arrière-ban of France to his
standards, and he always had a gallant
array of feudal nobility in his
antechambers, or around his headquarters.
But war, both on his part
and that of his antagonists, was carried
on, generally speaking, with
standing armies, supported by the
belligerent state. The vast, though
generally tumultuary array which the
Plantagenet or Valois sovereigns summoned
to their support, but which,
bound only to serve for forty days,
generally disappeared before a few
months of hostilities were over, could
no longer be relied on. The modern
system invented by revolutionary
France, of making war maintain war,
and sending forth starving multitudes
with arms in their hands, to subsist
by the plunder of the adjoining states,
was unknown. The national passions
had not been roused, which alone
would bring it into operation. The
decline of the feudal system forbade
the hope that contests could be maintained
by the chivalrous attachment
of a faithful nobility: the democratic
spirit had not been so aroused as to
supply its place by popular fervour.
Religious passions, indeed, had been
strongly excited; but they had prompted
men rather to suffer than to act:
the disputations of the pulpit were
their natural arena: in the last extremity
they were more allied to the
resignation of the martyr, than the
heroism of the soldier. Between the
two, there extended a long period
of above a century and a half,
during which governments had acquired
the force, and mainly relied
on the power, of standing armies; but
the resources at their disposal for
their support were so limited, that
the greatest economy in the husbanding
both of men and money was
indispensable.</p>

<p>Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, Edward III.,
and Henry V., were the models of
feudal leaders, and their wars were a
faithful mirror of the feudal contests.
Setting forth at the head of a force,
which, if not formidable in point of
numbers, was generally extremely so
from equipment and the use of arms,
the nobles around them were generally
too proud and high-spirited to
decline a combat, even on any possible
terms of disadvantage. They
took the field as the knights went to
a <i>champ clos</i>, to engage their adversaries
in single conflict; and it was
deemed equally dishonourable to retire
without fighting from the one as
the other. But they had no permanent
force at their disposal to secure
a lasting fruit even from the greatest
victories. The conquest of a petty
province, a diminutive fortress, was
often their only result. Hence the
desperate battles, so memorable in
warlike annals, which they fought,
and hence the miserable and almost
nugatory results which almost invariably
followed their greatest triumphs.
Cressy, Poictiers, and Azincour, followed
by the expulsion of the English
from France; Methven and Dunbar,
by their ignominious retreat from
Scotland; Ascalon and Ptolemais, by
their being driven from the Holy
Land, must immediately occur to every
reader. This state of war necessarily
imprinted a corresponding character
on the feudal generals. They were
high-spirited and daring in action&mdash;often
skilful in tactics&mdash;generally
ignorant of strategy&mdash;covetous of military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
renown, but careless of national
advancement&mdash;and often more solicitous
to conquer an adversary in
single conflict, than reduce a fortress,
or win a province.</p>

<p>But when armies were raised at
the expense, not of nobles, but of
kings&mdash;when their cost became a
lasting and heavy drain on the royal
exchequer&mdash;sovereigns grew desirous
of a more durable and profitable result
from their victories. Standing
armies, though commonly powerful,
often irresistible when accumulated
in large bodies&mdash;were yet extremely
expensive. They were felt the more
from the great difficulty of getting
the people in every country, at that
period, to submit to any considerable
amount of direct taxation. More
than one flourishing province had
been lost, or powerful monarchy overturned,
in the attempt to increase
such burdens; witness the loss of
Holland to Spain, the execution of
Charles I. in England. In this
dilemma, arising from the experienced
necessity of raising standing
armies on the one hand, and the
extreme difficulty of permanently
providing for them on the other, the
only resource was to spare both the
blood of the soldiers and the expenses
of the government as much as possible.
Durable conquests, acquisitions
of towns and provinces which could
yield revenues and furnish men, became
the great object of ambition.
The point of feudal honour was forgot
in the inanity of its consequences;
the benefits of modern conquests were
felt in the reality of their results. A
methodical cautious system of war
was thus impressed upon generals by
the necessities of their situation, and
the objects expected from them by
their respective governments. To
risk little and gain much, became the
great object: skill and stratagem
gradually took the place of reckless
daring; and the reputation of a general
came to be measured rather by the
permanent addition which his successes
had made to the revenues of
his sovereign, than the note with
which the trumpet of Fame had proclaimed
his own exploits.</p>

<p>Turenne was the first, and, in his
day, the greatest general in this new
and scientific system of war. He first
applied to the military art the resources
of prudent foresight, deep
thought, and profound combination;
and the results of his successes completely
justified the discernment which
had prompted Louis XIV. to place
him at the head of his armies. His
methodical and far-seeing campaigns
in Flanders, Franche Comté, Alsace,
and Lorraine, in the early part of the
reign of that monarch, added these
valuable provinces to France, which
have never since been lost. They have
proved more durable than the conquests
of Napoleon, which all perished
in the lifetime of their author. Napoleon's
legions passed like a desolating
whirlwind over Europe, but they gave
only fleeting celebrity, and entailed
lasting wounds on France. Turenne's
slow, or more methodical and more
cautious conquests, have proved lasting
acquisitions to the monarchy.
Nancy still owns the French allegiance;
Besançon and Strasbourg are
two of its frontier fortresses; Lille
yet is a leading stronghold in its iron
barrier. Napoleon, it is well known,
had the highest possible opinion of
that great commander. He was disposed
to place him at the head of
modern generals; and his very interesting
analysis of his campaigns
is not the least important part of his
invaluable memoirs.</p>

<p>Condé, though living in the same
age, and alternately the enemy and
comrade of Turenne, belonged to a
totally different class of generals,
and, indeed, seemed to belong to
another age of the world. He was
warmed in his heart by the spirit of
chivalry; he bore its terrors on his
sword's point. Heart and soul he was
heroic. Like Clive or Alexander, he
was consumed by that thirst for
fame, that ardent passion for glorious
achievements, which is the invariable
characteristic of elevated, and
the most inconceivable quality to
ordinary, minds. In the prosecution
of this object, no difficulties could
deter, no dangers daunt him. Though
his spirit was chivalrous&mdash;though
cavalry was the arm which suited his
genius, and in which he chiefly delighted,
he brought to the military
art the power of genius and the resources
of art; and no man could
make better use of the power which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">[705]</a></span>
the expiring spirit of feudality bequeathed
to its scientific successors.
He destroyed the Spanish infantry at
Rocroy and Lens, not by mere desultory
charges of the French cavalry,
but by efforts of that gallant body as
skilfully directed as those by which
Hannibal overthrew the Roman legions
at Thrasymene and Cannæ. His
genius was animated by the spirit of
the fourteenth, but it was guided by
the knowledge of the seventeenth,
century.</p>

<p>Bred in the school of Turenne,
placed, like him, at the head of a
force raised with difficulty, maintained
with still greater trouble, Marlborough
was the greatest general of the methodical
or scientific school which modern
Europe has produced. No man
knew better the importance of deeds
which fascinate the minds of men;
none could decide quicker, or strike
harder, when the proper time for action
arrived. None, when the decisive
crisis of the struggle approached,
could expose his person more fearlessly,
or lead his reserves more gallantly
into the very hottest of the
enemy's fire. To his combined intrepidity
and quickness, in thus bringing
the reserves, at the decisive
moment, into action, all his wonderful
victories, in particular Ramilies
and Malplaquet, are to be ascribed.
But, in the ordinary case,
he preferred the bloodless methods
of skill and arrangement. Combination
was his great <i>forte</i>, and there
he was not exceeded by Napoleon
himself. To deceive the enemy as to
the real point of attack&mdash;to perplex him
by marches and countermarches&mdash;to
assume and constantly maintain the
initiative&mdash;to win by skill what could
not be achieved by force, was his
great delight; and in that, the highest
branch of the military art, he was
unrivalled in modern times. He did
not despise stratagem. Like Hannibal,
he resorted to that arm frequently,
and with never-failing success. His
campaigns, in that respect, bear a
closer resemblance to those of the
illustrious Carthaginian than those of
any general in modern Europe. Like
him, too, his administrative and diplomatic
qualities were equal to his
military powers. By his address, he
retained in unwilling, but still effective
union, an alliance, unwieldy from
its magnitude, and discordant by its
jealousies; and kept, in willing multitudes,
around his standards, a <i>colluvies
omnium gentium</i>, of various
languages, habits, and religions&mdash;held
in subjection by no other bond but
the strong one of admiration for their
general, and a desire to share in his
triumphs.</p>

<p>Consummate address and never-failing
prudence were the great characteristics
of the English commander.
With such judgment did he measure
his strength with those of his adversary&mdash;so
skilfully did he choose the
points of attack, whether in strategy
or tactics&mdash;so well weighed were all
his enterprises, so admirably prepared
the means of carrying them
into execution, that none of them
ever miscarried. It was a common
saying at the time, which the preceding
narrative amply justifies, that
he never fought a battle which he did
not gain, nor laid siege to a town
which he did not take. This extraordinary
and unbroken success
extended to all his man&oelig;uvres, however
trivial; and it has been already
noticed, that the first disaster of any
moment which occurred to his arms
during <i>nine</i> successive and active
campaigns, was the destruction of a
convoy destined for the siege of St
Venant, in October 1710, by one of
Villars' detachments.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It was the
admirable powers of arrangement and
combination which he brought to bear
on all parts of his army, equally from
the highest to the lowest parts, which
was the cause of this extraordinary
and uninterrupted success.</p>

<p>He was often outnumbered by the
enemy, always opposed by a homogeneous
army, animated by one strong
national and military spirit; while he
was at the head of a discordant array
of many different nations, some of
them with little turn for warlike
exploit, others lukewarm, or even
treacherous in the cause. But notwithstanding
this, he never lost the
ascendant. From the time when he
first began the war on the banks of
the Maese in 1702, till his military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
career was closed in 1711, within the
iron barrier of France, by the intrigues
of his political opponents at home, he
never abandoned the initiative. He
was constantly on the offensive. When
inferior in force, as he often was, he
supplied the defect of military strength
by skill and combination; when his
position was endangered by the faults
or treachery of others, as was still
more frequently the case, he waited
till a false move on the part of his
adversaries enabled him to retrieve
his affairs by some brilliant and decisive
stroke. It was thus that he restored
the war in Germany, after the
affairs of the Emperor had been wellnigh
ruined, by the brilliant cross
march into Bavaria, and splendid victory
at Blenheim; and regained Flanders
for the Archduke by the stroke
at Ramilies, after the imperial cause
in that quarter had been all but lost
by the treacherous surrender of Ghent
and Bruges, in the very centre of his
water communications.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield, who knew him
well, said that he was a man of excellent
parts, and strong good sense,
but of no very shining genius. The
uninterrupted success of his campaigns,
however, joined to the unexampled
address with which he allayed
the jealousies and stilled the discords
of the confederacy whose armies he
led, decisively demonstrates that the
polished earl's opinion was not just;
and that his partiality for the graces
led him to ascribe an undue influence
in the great duke's career to the inimitable
suavity and courtesy of his
manner. His enterprises and stratagems,
his devices to deceive the enemy,
and counterbalance inferiority of
force by superiority of conduct; the
eagle eye which, in the decisive moment,
he brought to bear on the field
of battle, and the rapidity with
which in person he struck the final
blow from which the enemy never
recovered, bespeak the intuitive genius
of war. It was the admirable
<i>balance</i> of his mental qualities which
caused his originality to be under-valued;&mdash;no
one power stood out
in such bold relief as to overshadow
all the others, and rivet the eye by
the magnitude of its proportions.
Thus his consummate judgment made
the world overlook his invention; his
uniform prudence caused his daring
to be forgotten; his incomparable
combinations often concealed the capacious
mind which had put the whole
in motion. He was so uniformly successful,
that men forgot how difficult
it is always to succeed in war. It was
not till he was withdrawn from the
conduct of the campaign, and disaster
immediately attended the Allied arms,
and France resumed the ascendant
over the coalition, that Europe became
sensible who had been the soul of the
war, and how much had been lost
when his mighty understanding was
no longer at the head of affairs.</p>

<p>A most inadequate opinion would
be formed of Marlborough's mental
character, if his military exploits
alone were taken into consideration.
Like all other intellects of the first
order, he was equally capable of great
achievements in peace as in war, and
shone forth with not less lustre in the
deliberations of the cabinet, or the
correspondence of diplomacy, than
in directing columns on the field of
battle, or tracing out the line of
approaches in the attack of fortified
towns. Nothing could exceed the
judgment and address with which he
reconciled the jarring interests, and
smoothed down the rival pretensions,
of the coalesced cabinets. The danger
was not so pressing as to unite their
rival governments, as it afterwards did
those of the Grand Alliance in 1813,
for the overthrow of Napoleon; and incessant
exertions, joined to the highest
possible diplomatic address, judgment
of conduct, and suavity of manner,
were required to prevent the coalition,
on various occasions during the course
of the war, from falling to pieces. As
it was, the intrigues of Bolingbroke
and the Tories in England, and the
ascendency of Mrs Masham in the
Queen's bedchamber councils, at last
counterbalanced all his achievements,
and led to a peace which abandoned
the most important objects of the
war, and was fraught, as the event
has proved, with serious danger to
the independence and even existence
of England. His winter campaign at
the Allied courts, as he himself said,
always equalled in duration, and often
exceeded in importance and difficulty,
that in summer with the enemy; and
nothing is more certain, than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
if a man of less capacity had been
entrusted with the direction of its diplomatic
relations, the coalition would
have soon broken up without having
accomplished any of the objects for
which the war had been undertaken,
from the mere selfishness and dissensions
of the cabinets by whom it was
conducted.</p>

<p>With one blot, for which neither
the justice of history, nor the partiality
of biography either can or
should attempt to make any apology,
Marlborough's private character seems
to have been unexceptionable, and
was evidently distinguished by several
noble and amiable qualities. That he
was bred a courtier, and owed his
first elevation to the favour with which
he was regarded by one of the King's
mistresses, was not his fault:&mdash;It
arose, perhaps, necessarily from his
situation, and the graces and beauty
with which he had been so prodigally
endowed by nature. The young
officer of the Guards, who in the
army of Louis XIV. passed by the
name of the "handsome Englishman,"
could hardly be expected to be free
from the consequences of female partiality
at the court of Charles II. But
in maturer years, his conduct in public,
after William had been seated on
the throne, was uniformly consistent,
straightforward, and honourable.
He was a sincere patriot, and ardently
attached both to his country and the
principles of freedom, at a time when
both were wellnigh forgotten in the
struggles of party, and the fierce contests
for royal or popular favour.
Though bred up in a licentious court,
and early exposed to the most entrancing
of its seductions, he was in
mature life strictly correct, both in
his conduct and conversation. He
resisted every temptation to which his
undiminished beauty exposed him
after his marriage, and was never
known either to utter, or permit to be
uttered in his presence, a light or indecent
expression. He discouraged
to the utmost degree any instances of
intemperance or licentiousness in his
soldiers, and constantly laboured to
impress upon his men a sense of moral
duty and Supreme superintendence.
Divine service was regularly performed
in all his camps, both morning and
evening; previous to a battle, prayers
were read at the head of every regiment,
and the first act, after a victory,
was a solemn thanksgiving. "By
those means," says a contemporary
biographer, who served in his army,
"his camp resembled a quiet, well-governed
city. Cursing and swearing
were seldom heard among the officers;
a drunkard was the object of scorn:
and even the soldiers, many of them
the refuse and dregs of the nation, became,
at the close of one or two campaigns,
tractable, civil, sensible, and
clean, and had an air and spirit above
the vulgar."</p>

<p>In political life, during his career
after that event, he was consistent and
firm; faithful to his party, but more
faithful still to his country. He was a
generous friend, an attached, perhaps
too fond a husband. During the
whole of his active career, he retained
a constant sense of the superintendence
and direction of the Supreme
Being, and was ever the first to
ascribe the successes which he had
gained, to Divine protection; a disposition
which appeared with peculiar
grace amidst the din of arms, and the
flourish of trumpets for his own mighty
achievements. Even the one occasion
on which, like David, he fell from his
high principles, will be regarded by
the equitable observer with charitable,
if not forgiving eyes. He will recollect,
that perfection never yet belonged
to a child of Adam; he will measure
the dreadful nature of the struggle
which awaits an upright and generous
mind when loyalty and gratitude impel
one way, and religion and patriotism
another. Without attempting to
justify an officer who employs the
power bestowed by one government
to elevate another on its ruins, he will
yet reflect, that in such a crisis, even
the firmest heads and the best hearts
may be led astray. If he is wise, he will
ascribe the fault&mdash;for fault it was&mdash;not
so much to the individual, as the time
in which he lived; and feel a deeper
thankfulness that his own lot has been
cast in a happier age, when the great
moving passions of the human heart
act in the same direction, and a public
man need not fear that he is wanting
in his duty to his sovereign, because
he is performing that to his country.</p>

<p>Marlborough was often accused of
avarice: but his conduct through life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
sufficiently demonstrated that in him
the natural desire to accumulate a fortune,
which belongs to every rational
mind, was kept in subjection to more
elevated principles. His repeated refusal
of the government of the Netherlands,
with its magnificent appointment
of L.60,000 a-year, was a sufficient
proof how much he despised money
when it interfered with public duty;
his splendid edifices, both in London
and Blenheim, attest how little he
valued it for any other sake but as
it might be applied to noble and
worthy objects.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He possessed the
magnanimity in every thing which is
the invariable characteristic of real
greatness. Envy was unknown, suspicion
loathsome, to him. He often
suffered by the generous confidence
with which he trusted his enemies.
He was patient under contradiction;
placid and courteous both in his manners
and demeanour; and owed great
part of his success, both in the field
and in the cabinet, to the invariable
suavity and charm of his manner.
His humanity was uniformly conspicuous.
Not only his own soldiers, but
his enemies never failed to experience
it. Like Wellington, his attention to
the health and comforts of his men
was incessant; and, with his daring in
the field and uniform success in strategy,
endeared him in the highest
degree to the men. Troops of all
nations equally trusted him; and the
common saying, when they were in
any difficulty, "Never mind&mdash;'Corporal
John' will get us out of it," was
heard as frequently in the Dutch,
Danish, or German, as in the English
language. He frequently gave the
weary soldiers a place in his carriage,
and got out himself to accommodate
more; and his first care, after an engagement,
invariably was to visit the
field of battle, and do his utmost to
assuage the sufferings of the wounded,
both among his own men and those
of the enemy.</p>

<p>The character of this illustrious man
has been thus portrayed by two of the
greatest writers in the English language,
the latter of whom will not be
accused of undue partiality to his political
enemy. "It is a characteristic,"
says Adam Smith, "almost peculiar to
the great Duke of Marlborough, that
ten years of such uninterrupted and
such splendid successes as scarce any
other general could boast of, never
betrayed him into a single rash action,
scarce into a single rash word or expression.
The same temperate coolness
and self-command cannot, I think,
be ascribed to any other great warrior
of later times&mdash;not to Prince Eugene,
nor to the late King of Prussia, nor
to the great Prince of Condé, not
even to Gustavus Adolphus. Turenne
seems to have approached the nearest
to it: but several actions of his life
demonstrate that it was in him by no
means so perfect as in the great Duke
of Marlborough."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "By King William's
death," says Bolingbroke, "the
Duke of Marlborough was raised to
the head of the army, and indeed of
the confederacy, where he, a private
man, a subject, obtained by merit
and by management a more decided
influence than high birth, confirmed
authority, and even the crown of
Great Britain, had given to King
William. Not only all the parts of
that vast machine, the Grand Alliance,
were kept more compact and
entire, but a more rapid and vigorous
motion was given to the whole; and
instead of languishing or disastrous
campaigns, we saw every scene of
the war full of action. All those
wherein he appeared, and many of
those wherein he was not then an
actor, but abettor, however, of their
actions, were crowned with the most
triumphant success. I take with
pleasure this opportunity of doing
justice to that great man, whose faults
I know, whose virtues I admire, and
whose memory, <i>as the greatest general
and greatest minister that our country
or any other has produced</i>, I honour."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h2>MILDRED;</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Tale.</span></h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Part I.</span> <span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span></h4>

<p>The town of Wimborne, in Dorsetshire,
boasts the possession of a very
ancient cathedral-like church, dignified
with the title of Minster, but, with
this exception, is as utterly devoid, we
believe, of all interest to the traveller,
as any of the numerous country-towns
which he rapidly passes through, and
so gladly quits, wondering for the
moment how it is that any one can
possibly consent to be left behind in
them. He who has journeyed from
Southampton to Poole will remember
the town, from the circumstance that
he quitted by the same narrow streets
by which he entered it, his road not
passing directly through, but forming
an angle at this point. He will call
to mind what appeared an unaccountable
turning and twisting about of the
coach, whilst the horses were being
changed, and a momentary alarm at
finding that he was retracing his steps;
he will remember the two massive
square towers of the old church, peering
above the roofs of the houses; and
this is all that he will know, or have
the least desire to know, of the town
of Wimborne.</p>

<p>If, however, the traveller should
be set down in this quiet place, and
be compelled to wait there half a day
for the arrival of some other coach to
carry him to his destination, he will
probably wile away his time by a
visit to its antique and venerable
church; and after climbing, by the
dark and narrow staircase, to the top
of one of its towers, he will be somewhat
surprised to find himself&mdash;in a
library! A small square room is
fitted up with shelves, whereon a
number of books are deposited, and
the centre is occupied by a large
reading-desk, and a massive oak table,
apparently coeval with the tower itself,
and which was probably placed there
before the roof was put on, since it
never could have been introduced by
the stairs or through the window. It
is no modern library, be it understood&mdash;no
vestry reading-room connected
with the Sunday school of the
place; they are old books, black-letter
quartos, illuminated missals, now dark
and mouldy, and whose parchment
has acquired no pleasant odour from
age. By no means is it a circulating
library, for some of the books are
still chained to the reading-desk; and
many more have their rusty iron
chain twisted about them, by which
they, in their turn, were bound to the
desk. If the traveller should not be
favoured with that antiquarian taste
which finds a charm in decyphering,
out of mouldy and black-letter volumes,
what would not be worth his
perusal in the most luxurious type of
modern days, he will at least derive
some pleasure from opening the little
windows of the tower, and inhaling
the fresh breeze that will blow in
upon him, and in looking over an
extensive prospect of green meadows,
with their little river meandering
about in them. It must have formed
a pleasant retreat at one time to the
two or three learned clerks, or minor
canons, or neighbouring monks or
friars&mdash;we may be sure there were
never many of such students&mdash;who
used to climb this turret for their
morning or their evening lucubrations.</p>

<p>The only student who had, perhaps
for some centuries, frequented it&mdash;and
she brought her own books with her,
and was very unlike either learned
clerk, or monk, or friar&mdash;was Mildred
Willoughby. She used to delight&mdash;a
taste savouring of extreme youth&mdash;to
bring the book she was perusing from
her own comfortable parlour, to climb
up with it to this solitary height, and
there read it alone. She had no difficulty
in obtaining from the parish-clerk
permission to be left in this
chosen solitude&mdash;to draw the one
wooden chair it possessed to the window,
and there to sit, and read, or
muse, or look upon the landscape,
just as long as she pleased. It did
not very frequently happen that this
functionary was called upon to exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
the old tower to the curiosity of
strangers; but if this occurred whilst
she was thus occupied, she would rise
from her seat, and for a moment put
on the air of a visitor also&mdash;walk
slowly round the room, looking at the
backs of the books, or out of the window
at the prospect, as if she saw
them for the first time! and when the
company had retreated, (and there
was little to detain them long,) would
quietly return to her chair, her study,
or her reverie.</p>

<p>One reason she might have given,
beside the romantic and pensive mood
it inspired, for her choice of this retreat&mdash;the
charm of being alone. Nothing
could be more quiet&mdash;to look at
the exterior&mdash;than the house she called
her home. It stood at the extremity
of the town, protected from the road
by its own neat inclosure of turf and
gravel-walk&mdash;surely as remote from
every species of disturbance or excitement
as the most devoted student
could desire. We question even whether
a barrel-organ or a hurdy-gurdy
was ever known to commit an outrage
upon its tranquillity; and for its
interior, were not Mr and Miss Bloomfield
(they were brother and sister,
uncle and aunt of Mildred) the most
staid, orderly, methodical persons in
the world? Did not the bachelor
uncle cover every part of the house,
and the kitchen stairs in particular,
with thick carpet, in order that the
footsteps of John and the maid should
not disquiet him? The very appearance
of the garden, both before and
behind the house, was sufficient to
show how orderly a genius presided
over it. Could box be cut more
neatly? or gravel-walks be kept
cleaner? You saw a tall lance-like
instrument standing by the steps of
the back-door, its constant place.
With this Mr Bloomfield frequently
made the circuit of his garden, but
with no hostile purpose: he merely
transfixed with it the dry leaves or
the splinters of wood that had strayed
upon his gravel, carrying them off in
triumph to a neat wooden receptacle,
where they were both imprisoned and
preserved. And Miss Bloomfield, she
also was one of the most amiable of
women, and as attached to a quiet
and orderly house as her brother.
Neither could any two persons be
more kind, or more fond of their
niece, than they were. But it was
from this very kindness, this very
fondness, that Mildred found it so
pleasant at times to escape. Her
aunt, especially, was willing to grant
her any indulgence but that of being
alone. This her love for her niece,
and her love of talking, would rarely
permit. Neither could Mildred very
graciously petition for this unsocial
privilege. In youth, nothing is so
delightful as solitude, especially when
it is procured by stealth, by some
subtle contrivance, some fiction or
pretence; and many a time did her
aunt find it necessary to pursue Mildred
to her own chamber, and many
a time did she bring her down into
the parlour, repeating, with unfeigned
surprise, and a tone of gentle complaint,
the always unanswerable question&mdash;what
she <i>could</i> be doing so long
in her own room? Therefore it was
that she was fain to steal out alone&mdash;take
her walk through the churchyard,
ascend the tower, enter its little
library, and plant herself in its old
arm-chair for an hour of solitary reading
or thinking.</p>

<p>Mildred Willoughby was born in
India, and her parents (the greatest
misery attendant upon a residence in
that climate) were compelled to send
her to England to be reared, as well
as educated. She had been placed
under the care of her uncle and aunt.
These had always continued to live
together&mdash;bachelor and spinster. As
their united incomes enabled them to
surround themselves with every comfort
and personal luxury, and as they
were now of a very mature age, it was
no longer considered to be in the chapter
of probabilities that either of them
would change their condition. Miss
Bloomfield, in her youth, was accounted
a beauty&mdash;the <i>belle</i> of Wimborne;
and we may be sure that personal
charms, a very amiable disposition,
and a considerable fortune, could not
fail to bring her numerous admirers
and suitors. But her extreme placidity
of temper no passion seems ever
to have ruffled; and it did so happen,
that though her hand had often been
solicited, no opportunity of marriage
had been offered to her which would
not have put in jeopardy some of those
comforts and indulgences to which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
was habituated. She was pleased with
the attentions of gentlemen, and was
studious to attract them; but there
was nothing in that word <i>love</i> which
could have compensated for the loss
of her favourite attendants, or of that
pretty little carriage that drew her
about the country.</p>

<p>As for Mr Bloomfield, it was generally
supposed that he had suffered
from more than one tender disappointment,
having always had the misfortune
to fix his affections just where
they could not be returned. But
those who knew him well would say,
that Josiah Bloomfield was, in fact,
too timid and irresolute a man ever
to have married&mdash;that being himself
conscious of this, yet courting, at the
same time, the excitement of a tender
passion, he invariably made love where
he was sure to be rejected. Many a
fascinating girl came before him, whom
he might have won, from whose society,
for this very reason, he quietly
withdrew, to carry his sighs to some
quarter where a previous engagement,
or some other obstacle, was sure to
procure him a denial. He thus had
all the pleasing pains of wooing, and
earned the credit for great sensibility,
whilst he hugged himself in the safe
felicity of a single life. By this time,
a more confirmed or obdurate bachelor
did not exist; yet he was pleased to
be thought to wear the willow, and
would, from time to time, endeavour
to extort compassion by remote hints
at the sufferings he had endured from
unreturned affection.</p>

<p>Two such persons, it will be supposed,
were at first somewhat alarmed
at the idea of taking into their establishment
a little girl about four or
five years old. Indeed, they had, in
the first instance, only so far agreed
to take charge of her as to find her a
fit school&mdash;to receive her at the holidays&mdash;and,
in this distant manner,
superintend her education. But Mildred
proved so quiet, so tractable,
and withal so cheerful a child, that
they soon resolved to depart from this
plan. She had not been long in the
house before it would have been a
great distress to both of them to have
parted with her. It was determined
that she should reside perpetually
with them, and that the remittances
received from India should be employed
in obtaining the very best
masters that could be procured from
Bath or Exeter. Mr Bloomfield found,
in the superintendence of Mildred's
education, an employment which made
the day half as short as it had ever
been before. He was himself a man
fond of reading; and if he had not a
very large store of thoughts, he had
at least an excellent library, into
which Mildred, who had now arrived
at the age of fifteen, had already
begun to penetrate.</p>

<p>And books&mdash;her music&mdash;&amp;c., a few
friends, more distinguished by good-breeding
and good-nature than by
any vivacity of mind, were all the
world of Mildred Willoughby, and it
was a world that there seemed little
probability of her getting beyond. It
had been expected that about this
time she would have returned to India
to her parents; but her mother had
died, and her father had expressed no
wish that she should be sent out to
him. On the contrary, beyond certain
pecuniary remittances, and these
came through an agent's hands, there
was nothing to testify that he bore
any remembrance of his daughter.
Of her father, very contradictory reports
had reached her; some said that
he had married again, and had formed
an engagement of which he was not
very proud; others that he had quitted
the service, and was now travelling,
no one knew where, about the world.
At all events, he appeared to have
forgotten that he had a daughter in
England; and Mildred was almost
justified in considering herself&mdash;as she
did in her more melancholy moments&mdash;as
in fact an orphan, thrown upon
the care of an uncle and aunt, and
dependent almost entirely upon them.</p>

<p>One fine summer's day, as she was
enjoying her lofty solitude in the minster
tower, a visitor had been allowed
to grope up his way unattended into
its antique library. On entering, he
was not a little startled to see before
him in this depository of mouldering
literature a blooming girl in all the
freshness and beauty of extreme youth.
He hesitated a moment whether to
approach and disturb so charming a
vision. But, indeed, the vision was
very soon disturbed. For Mildred,
on her side, was still more startled at
this entrance, alone and suddenly, of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
very handsome young man&mdash;for such
the stranger was&mdash;and blushed deeply
as she rose from her chair and attempted
to play as usual the part of
casual visitor. He bowed&mdash;what
could he less?&mdash;and made some apology
for his having startled her by his
abrupt entrance.</p>

<p>The stranger's manner was so quiet
and unpresuming, that the timidity of
Mildred soon disappeared, and before
she had time to think what was most
<i>proper</i> to do, she found herself in a
very interesting conversation with one
who evidently was as intelligent as he
was well-bred and good-looking. She
had let fall her book in her hurry to rise.
He picked it up, and as he held the
elegantly bound volume in his hand,
which ludicrously contrasted with the
mouldy and black-letter quartos that
surrounded them, he asked with a
smile, on which shelf he was to deposit
it. "This fruit," said he, "came
from another orchard." And seeing
the title at the back, he added, "Italian
I might have expected to find in a
young lady's hand, but I should have
looked for a Tasso, not an Alfieri."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied gaily, "a damsel
discovered reading in this old
turret ought to have book of chivalry
in her hand. I have read Tasso,
but I do not prefer him. Alfieri presents
me quite as much as Tasso with
a new world to live in, and it is a more
real world. I seem to be learning
from him the real feelings of men."</p>

<p>The stranger was manifestly struck
by this kind of observation from one
so young, and still more by the simple
and unpretending manner in which it
was uttered. Mildred had not the
remotest idea of talking criticism,
she was merely expressing her own
unaffected partialities. He would
have been happy to prolong the conversation,
but the clerk, or verger,
who had missed his visitor&mdash;as well
he might, for his visitor had purposely
given him the slip, as all wise men
invariably do to all cicerones of
whatever description&mdash;had at length
tracked his fugitive up the tower, and
into the library. His entrance interrupted
their dialogue, and compelled
the stranger very soon afterwards to
retreat. He made his bow to the fair
lady of the tower and descended.</p>

<p>Mildred read very little more that
day, and if she lingered somewhat
longer in meditation, her thoughts had
less connexion than ever with antiquities
of any kind. She descended,
and took her way home. The probability
that she might meet the
stranger in passing through the town&mdash;albeit
there was nothing, disagreeable
in the thought&mdash;made her walk
with unusual rapidity, and bend her
eyes pertinaciously upon the ground.
The consequence of which was, that
in turning the corner of a street which
she passed almost every day of her
life, she contrived to entangle her
dress in some of the interesting hardware
of the principal ironmonger of
the place, who, for the greater convenience
of the inhabitants, was
accustomed to advance his array of
stoves and shovels far upon the
pavement, and almost before their
feet. As she turned and stooped to
disengage her dress, she found that
relief and rescue were already at
hand. The stranger knight, who had
come an age too late to release her as
a captive from the tower, was affording
the best assistance he could to
extricate her from entanglement with
a kitchen-range. Some ludicrous idea
of this kind occurred to both at the
same time&mdash;their eyes met with a
smile&mdash;and their hands had very
nearly encountered as they both bent
over the tenacious muslin. The task,
however, was achieved, and a very
gracious "thank you" from one of
the most musical of voices repaid the
stranger for his gallantry.</p>

<p>That evening Mildred happened to
be sitting near the window&mdash;it must
have been by merest hazard, for she
very rarely occupied that part of the
room&mdash;as the Bath coach passed their
gates. A gentleman seated on the
roof appeared to recognise her&mdash;at
least, he took his hat off as he passed.
Was it the same?&mdash;and what if it
were? Evidently he was a mere
passer-by, who had been detained in
the town a few hours, waiting for this
coach. Would he ever even think
again of the town of Wimborne&mdash;of
its old minster&mdash;or its tower&mdash;and
the girl he surprised sitting there, in
its little antique library?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h4>

<p>Between two or three years have
elapsed, and our scene changes from
the country town of Wimborne to the
gay and pleasant capital of Belgium.</p>

<p>Mr and Miss Bloomfield had made
a bold, and, for them, quite a tremendous
resolution, to take a trip upon
the Continent, which should extend&mdash;as
far as their courage held out. The
pleasure and profit this would afford
their niece, was no mean inducement
to the enterprise. Mr Bloomfield
judged that his ward, after the course
of studies she had pursued, and the
proficiency she had attained in most
feminine accomplishments, was ripe
to take advantage of foreign travel.
Mr Bloomfield judged wisely; but Mr
Bloomfield neither judged, nor was,
perhaps, capable of judging how far,
in fact, the mind of his niece <i>had</i> advanced,
or what singular good use she
had made of his own neglected library.
She had been grappling with all sorts
of books&mdash;of philosophy and of science,
as well as of history and poetry. But
that cheerful quietude which distinguished
her manner, concealed these
more strenuous efforts of her mind.
She never talked for display&mdash;she had,
indeed, no arena for display&mdash;and the
wish for it was never excited in her
mind. What she read and thought,
she revolved in herself, and was perfectly
content. How it might have
been had she lived amongst those who
would have called her forth, and overwhelmed
her with praise, it would be
difficult to tell. As it was, Mildred
Willoughby presented to the imagination
the most fascinating combination
of qualities it would be possible
to put together. A young girl of most
exquisite beauty, (she had grown paler
than when we last saw her, but this
had only given increased lustre to her
blue eye)&mdash;of manners the most unaffected&mdash;of
a temper always cheerful,
always tranquil&mdash;was familiar with
trains of deep reflection&mdash;possessed a
practised intellect and really cultivated
mind. In this last respect,
there was not a single person in all
Wimborne or its neighbourhood who
had divined her character. That she
was a charming girl, though a little
too pale&mdash;very amiable, though a little
too reserved&mdash;of a temper provokingly
calm, for she was not ruffled even
where she ought to be&mdash;and that she
sang well, and played well; such
would have been the summary of her
good qualities from her best and most
intimate friends. She was now enjoying,
with her uncle and aunt&mdash;but in
a manner how different from theirs!&mdash;the
various novelties, great and small,
which a foreign country presents to
the eye.</p>

<p>Those who, in their travels, estimate
the importance of any spot by
its distance or its difficulty of access,
will hardly allow such a place as Brussels
to belong to <i>foreign parts</i>. It is
no more than an excursion to Margate:
it is but a day's journey. True;
but your day's journey has brought
you to another people&mdash;to another
religion. We are persuaded that a
man shall travel to Timbuctoo, and
he shall not gain for himself a stronger
impression of novelty, than a sober
Protestant shall procure by entering
the nearest country where the Roman
Catholic worship is in full practice.
He has seen cathedrals&mdash;many and
beautiful&mdash;but they were mere architectural
monuments, half deserted,
one corner only employed for the modest
service of his church&mdash;the rest a
noble space for the eye to traverse, in
which he has walked, hat in hand,
meditating on past times and the
middle ages. But if he cross the
Channel, those past times&mdash;they have
come back again; those middle ages&mdash;he
is in the midst of them. The empty
cathedral has become full to overflowing;
there are the lights burning in
mid-day, and he hears the Latin
chant, and sees high-priests in gorgeous
robes making mystic evolutions
about the altar; and there is the incense,
and the sprinkling of holy water,
and the tinkling bell, and whatever
the Jew or the Pagan has in
times past bequeathed to the Christian.
Or let him only look up the street.
Here comes, tottering in the air, upon
the shoulders of its pious porters, Our
Lady herself, with the Holy Child in
one arm, and her sceptre in the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
and the golden crown upon her head.
Here she is in her satin robe, stiff
with embroidery, and gay with lace,
and decked with tinsel ornaments beyond
our power of description. If the
character of the festival require it, she
is borne by six or eight maidens clad
in white, with wreaths of white roses
on their heads; and you hear it whispered,
as they approach, that such a
one is beautiful Countess of C&mdash;&mdash;;
and, countess or not, there is amongst
those bearers a face very beautiful,
notwithstanding that the heat of the
day, and a burden of no light weight,
has somewhat deranged the proportions
of the red and white which had
been so cunningly laid on. And then
comes the canopy of cloth of gold,
borne over the bare head of the venerable
priest, who holds up to the
people, inclosed in a silver case, imitative
of rays of glory, the sacred
host; holds it up with both his hands,
and fastens both his eyes devoutly on
the back of it; and boys in their
scarlet tunics, covered with white
lace, are swinging the censor before
it; and the shorn priests on each side,
with lighted tapers in their hands, tall
as staves, march, chanting forth&mdash;we
regret to say, with more vehemence
than melody.</p>

<p>Is not all this strange enough?
The state-carriage of the King of the
Ashantees was, some years ago, captured
in war, and exhibited in London;
and a curious vehicle it was,
with its peacocks' feathers, and its
large glass beads hung round the
roof to glitter and jingle at the same
time. But the royal carriage of the
Ashantees, or all that the court of
the Ashantees could possibly display,
is not half so curious, half so strange
to any meditative spirit, as this image
of the Holy Virgin met as it parades
the streets, or seen afterwards deposited
in the centre of the temple, surrounded
by pots of flowers, real and
artificial, by vases filled with lilies of
glazed muslin, and altogether tricked
out with such decorations as a child
would lavish on its favourite doll if
it had an infinite supply of tinsel.</p>

<p>And they worship <i>that</i>!</p>

<p>"No!" exclaims some very candid
gentleman. "No sir, they by no
means worship it; and you must be a
very narrow-minded person if you
think so. Such images are employed
by the Catholic as representatives, as
symbols only&mdash;visible objects to direct
his worship to that which is
invisible." O most candid of men!
and most liberal of Protestants! we
do not say that Dr Wiseman or M.
Chateaubriand worship images. But
just step across the water&mdash;we do not
ask you to travel into Italy or Spain,
where the symptoms are ten times
more violent&mdash;just walk into some of
these churches in Belgium, <i>and use
your own eyes</i>. It is but a journey of
four-and-twenty hours; and if you
are one of those who wish to bring
into our own church the more frequent
use of form and ceremony and
visible symbol, it will be the most
salutory journey you ever undertook.
Meanwhile consider, and explain to
us, why it is&mdash;if images are understood
to have only this subordinate
function&mdash;that one image differs so
much from another in honour and
glory. This Virgin, whom we have
seen parade the streets, is well received
and highly respected; but there
are other Virgins&mdash;ill-favoured, too,
and not at all fit to act as representatives
of any thing feminine&mdash;who are
infinitely more honoured and observed.
The sculpture of Michael Angelo
never wins so much devotion as you
shall see paid here, in one of their innumerable
churches, to a dark, rude,
and odious misrepresentation of Christ.
They put a mantle on it of purple
cotton, edged with white, and a reed
in its hand, and they come one after
the other, and kiss its dark feet; and
mothers bring their infants, and put
their soft lips to the wound that the
nail made, and then depart with full
sense of an act of piety performed.
And take this into account, that such
act of devotion is no casual enthusiasm,
no outbreak of passionate piety
overleaping the bounds of reason; it
is done systematically, methodically;
the women come with their green tin
cans, slung upon their arm, full of
their recent purchases in the market,
you see them enter&mdash;approach&mdash;put
down the can&mdash;kiss&mdash;take up the can,
and depart. They have fulfilled a
duty.</p>

<p>But we have not arrived in Brussels
to loiter in churches or discuss
theology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monsieur and the ladies will go
to the ball to-night," said their obliging
host to our party. "It is an annual
ball," he continued, "given by
the Philanthropical Society for the
benefit of the poor. Their Majesties,
the king and the queen, will honour
it with their presence, and it is especially
patronised by your fair countrywomen.</p>

<p>"Enough," said Mr Bloomfield;
"we will certainly go to the ball. To
be in the same room with a living
king and queen&mdash;it is an opportunity
by no means to be lost."</p>

<p>"And then," said Miss Bloomfield,
"it is an act of charity."</p>

<p>This species of charity is very prevalent
at Brussels. You dance there
out of pure commiseration. It is an
excellent invention, this gay benevolence.
You give, and you make no
sacrifice; you buy balls and concerts
with the money you drop into the
beggar's hat; charity is all sweetness.
Poverty itself wears quite a
festive air; the poor are the farmers-general
of our pleasures; it is they
who give the ball. Long live the
dance! Long live the poor!</p>

<p>They drive to the ball-room in the
Rue Ducale. They enter an oblong
room, spacious, of good proportions,
and brilliantly lit up with that gayest
of all artificial lights&mdash;the legitimate
wax candle, thickly clustered in numerous
chandeliers. Two rows of
Corinthian columns support the roof,
and form a sort of arcade on either
side for spectators or the promenade,
the open space in the centre being, of
course, devoted to the dance. At the
upper end is a raised dais with chairs
of state for their Majesties. What,
in day-time, were windows are filled
with large mirrors, most commodiously
reflecting the fair forms that stand
or pass before them. How smooth is
the inlaid polished floor! and how it
seems to foretell the dance for which
its void space is so well prepared!
No incumbrance of furniture here;
no useless decorations. Some cushioned
forms covered with crimson velvet,
some immense vases occupying
the corners of the room filled with
exotic plants, are all that could be
admitted of one or the other.</p>

<p>The orchestra, established in a
small gallery over the door, strikes
up the national air, and the royal
party, attended by their suite, proceed
through the centre of the room,
bowing right and left. They take
their seats. That instant the national
air changes to a rapid waltz,
and in the twinkling of an eye, the
whole of that spacious floor is covered
thick with the whirling multitude.
The sober Mr Bloomfield, to whom
such a scene is quite a novelty, grows
giddy with the mere view of it. He
looks with all his might, but he
ought to have a hundred pairs of
eyes to watch the mazes of this
dance. One couple after another appear
and vanish as if by enchantment.
He sees a bewitching face&mdash;he
strives to follow it&mdash;impossible!&mdash;in
a minute fifty substitutes are presented
to him&mdash;it is lost in a living
whirlpool of faces.</p>

<p>To one long accustomed to the
quiet and monotony of a country life,
it would be difficult to present a spectacle
more novel or striking than this
of a public ball-room; and though
for such a novelty it was not necessary
to cross the water, yet assuredly,
in his own country, Mr Bloomfield
would never have been present at
such a spectacle. We go abroad as
much to throw ourselves for a time
into new manners of life, as to find
new scenes of existence. He stood
bewildered. Some two hundred couples
gyrating like mad before him. Sometimes
the number would thin, and the
fervour of the movement abate&mdash;the
floor began, in parts, to be visible&mdash;the
storm and the whirlwind were
dying away. But a fresh impulse
again seized on both musicians and
dancers&mdash;the throng of these gentle
dervishes, of these amiable mænads,
became denser than ever&mdash;the movement
more furious&mdash;the music seemed
to madden them and to grow mad itself:
he shut his eyes, and drew back
quite dizzy from the scene.</p>

<p>It is a singular phenomenon, this
waltz, retained as it is in the very
heart of our cold and punctilious civilisation.
How have we contrived,
amidst our quiet refinement and fastidious
delicacy, to preserve an amusement
which has in it the very spirit
of the Cherokee Indian? There is nothing
sentimental&mdash;nothing at all, in
the waltz. In this respect, mammas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
need have no alarm. It is the mere
excitement of rapid movement&mdash;a
dextrous and delirious rotation. It
is the enthusiasm only of the feet&mdash;the
ecstacy of mere motion. Yes!
just at that moment when, on the extended
arm of the cavalier, the soft
and rounded arm of his partner is
placed so gently and so gracefully&mdash;(as
for the hand upon the whalebone
waist no electricity comes that way)&mdash;just
then there may be a slight
emotion which would be dangerous
if prolonged; but the dance begins,
and there is no room for any other
rapture than that of its own swift and
giddy course. There are no beatings
of the heart after that; only pulsations
of the great artery.</p>

<p>Found where it is, it is certainly a
remarkable phenomenon, this waltz.
Look now at that young lady&mdash;how
cold, formal, stately!&mdash;how she has
been trained to act the little queen
amongst her admirers and flatterers!
See what a <i>reticence</i> in all her demeanour.
Even feminine curiosity,
if not subdued, has been dissimulated;
and though she notes every
thing and every body, and can describe,
when she returns home, the
dress of half the ladies in the room,
it is with an eye that seems to notice
nothing. Her head has just been released
from the hair-dresser, and
every hair is elaborately adjusted.
To the very holding of an enormous
bouquet, "round as my shield,"
which of itself seems to forbid all
thoughts of motion&mdash;every thing has
been arranged and re-arranged. She
sits like an alabaster figure; she
speaks, it is true, and she smiles as
she speaks; but evidently the smile
and the speech have no natural connexion
with one another; they co-exist,
but they have both been quite
separately studied, prepared, permitted.
Well, the waltz strikes up, and
at a word from that bowing gentleman,
himself a piece of awful formality,
this pale, slow, and graceful automaton
has risen. Where is she now?
She is gone&mdash;vanished&mdash;transformed.
She is nowhere to be seen. But in
her stead there is a breathless girl,
with flushed cheeks, ringlets given to
the wind, dress flying all abroad, spinning
round the room, darting diagonally
across it, whirling fast as her little
feet can carry her&mdash;faster, faster&mdash;for
it is her more powerful cavalier,
who, holding her firmly by the waist,
sustains and augments her speed.</p>

<p>Perhaps some ingenious mind may
discover a profound philosophy in all
this; perhaps, by retaining this authorised
outlet for the mere rage of
movement, the rest of civilised life is
better protected against any disturbance
of that quietude of deportment
which it is so essential to maintain.</p>

<p>But if the waltz appeared to Mr
Bloomfield like dancing gone mad, the
quadrille which divided the evening
with it, formed a sort of compensation
by carrying matters to the opposite
extreme. A fly in a glue-pot moves
with about the same alacrity, and apparently
the same amount of pleasure,
as did the dancers this evening in
their crowded quadrille. As no one,
of course, could be permitted to stand
with his back to royalty, they were
arranged, not in squares, but in two
long files as in a country-dance. The
few couples that stood near their
majesties were allowed a reasonable
share of elbow-room, and could get
through their evolutions with tolerable
composure. But as the line receded
from this point, the dancers
stood closer and closer together, and
at the other extremity of the room it
became nothing less than a dense
crowd; a crowd where people were
making the most persevering and ingenious
efforts to accomplish the most
spiritless of movements&mdash;with a world
of pains just crawling in and out
again. The motions of this <i>dancing</i>
crowd viewed from a proper elevation,
would exactly resemble those slow
and mysterious evolutions one sees,
on close examination, in the brown
dust of a cheese, in that condition
which some people call ripe, and
others rotten.</p>

<p>As to Miss Bloomfield, she keeps
her eyes, for the most part, on the
king and queen. Having expected to
see them rise and join the dance, she
was somewhat disappointed to find
them retain their seats, the king chatting
to a lady at his right, the queen
to a lady on her left. Assuredly, if
there were any one in that assembly
who had come there out of charity, it
was their Majesties. Or rather, they
were there in performance of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
the duties of royalty, perhaps not the
least onerous, that of showing itself in
public on certain occasions. When
they rose, it was to take their leave,
which they were doubtless very glad
to do. Nor, indeed, were those who
had been most attracted by the advertised
presence of their Majesties sorry
to witness their departure. They
would carry many away with them&mdash;there
would be more room for the
dance&mdash;and the quadrille could reassume
its legitimate form.</p>

<p>But Mildred&mdash;what was she doing
or thinking all this time? To her the
scene was entirely new; for though
Mr and Miss Bloomfield probably
attended county balls in their youth,
they had not, for some years, so far
deviated from the routine of their
lives as to frequent any such assemblies.
Besides, she had to encounter,
what they certainly had not, the gaze
of every eye as she passed, and the
whispered exclamations of applause.
But to have judged from her manner&mdash;from
that delightful composure which
always distinguished it, as free from
insipidity as from trepidation or fluster,
you would have thought her quite
familiar with such scenes and such
triumphs. Reflection supplied the
place of experience. You saw that
those clear blue eyes, from which she
looked out with such a calm and keen
inquiry, were by no means to be imposed
on; that they detected at once
the true meaning of the scene before
her. She was solicited to dance, but
neither the waltz nor the quadrille
were at all enticing, and she contented
herself with the part of spectator.
Her chief amusement was derived
from the novel physiognomies which
the room presented; and indeed the
assortment, comprising, as it did, a
sprinkling of many nations&mdash;French
and Belgian, English and German&mdash;was
sufficiently varied. There were
even two or three <i>lions</i> of the first
magnitude, who (judging from the
supreme <i>hauteur</i> with which they surveyed
the scene) must have been
imported from the patron capital of
Paris. Lions, bearded magnificently&mdash;no
mere luxuriance, or timid overgrowth
of hair, but the genuine full
black glossy beard&mdash;faces that might
have walked out of Titian's canvass.
Mildred would have preferred them
in the canvass; they were much too
sublime for the occasion. Then there
were two or three young English
<i>exquisites</i>, gliding about with that
published modesty that proclaimed
indifference, which seeks notoriety by
the very graceful manner in which it
seems struggling to avoid it. You
see a smile upon their lips as they
disengage themselves from the crowd,
as if they rallied themselves for taking
any share in the bustle or excitement
of the scene; but that smile, be it
understood, is by no means intended
to escape detection.</p>

<p>There were a greater number of fat
and elderly gentlemen than Mildred
would have expected, taking part in
the dance, or circulating about the
room with all or more than the vivacity
of youth. How happy!&mdash;how
supremely blest!&mdash;seems that rotund
and bald-headed sire, who, standing
on the edge of the dais, now forsaken
by their Majesties, surveys the whole
assembly, and invites the whole assembly
to return the compliment.
How beautifully the bland sympathy
he feels for others mingles with and
swells his sense of self-importance!
How he dominates the whole scene!
How fondly patronises! And then
his smile!&mdash;why, his heart is dancing
with them all; it is beating time to
twice two hundred feet. An old
friend approaches him&mdash;he is happy
too&mdash;would shake him by the hand.
The hand he gives; but he cannot
withdraw his eye from the wide scene
before him; he cannot possibly call
in and limit his sympathies at that
moment to one friend, however old
and dear. And he who solicits his
hand, he also is looking around him
at the same time, courting the felicitations
of the crowd, who will not
fail to observe that he too is there,
and there amongst friends.</p>

<p>In the female portion of the assembly
there was not so much novelty.
Mildred could only remark that there
was a large proportion of <i>brunettes</i>, and
that the glossy black hair was parted
on the head and smoothed down on
either side with singular neatness and
precision. Two only out of this part
of the community attracted her particular
notice, and they were of the
most opposite description. Near to
her stood a lady who might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
either thirty, or forty, or fifty, for all
that her sharp and lively features betrayed.
She wore one of those small
round hats, with the feather drooping
round it, which formed, we believe, a
part of the costume of Louis XV.; and
that which drew the notice of Mildred
was the strange resemblance she bore,
in appearance and manner, to the
portraitures which some French memoirs
had made familiar to her imagination.
As she watched her in conversation
with an officer in full regimentals,
who stood by her side, her
fancy was transported to Versailles
or St Cloud. What a caustic pleasantry!
What a malicious vivacity!
It was impossible to doubt that the
repartees which passed between her
and her companion were such as to
make the ears of the absent tingle.
There were some reputations suffering
there as the little anecdote was so
trippingly narrated. Her physiognomy
was redolent of pleasant scandal&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Tolerably mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a wash she'd hardly stew a child;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">but to extract a jest, there was no
question she would have distilled half
the reputations in the room.</p>

<p>The other object of Mildred's curiosity,
we pause a moment to describe,
because she will cross our path again
in the course of this narrative.
Amongst all the costly and splendid
dresses of her sex, there was a young
girl in some simple striped stuff, the
most unsophisticated gown imaginable,
falling flat about her, with a
scanty cape of the same material
about her neck&mdash;the walking-dress,
in short, of a school-girl. The only
preparation for the ball-room consisted
of a wreath imitative of daisies,
just such a wreath as she might have
picked up in passing through a Catholic
cemetry. And the dress quite
suited the person. There she stood
with eyes and mouth wide open, as if
she saw equally through both apertures,
full of irrepressible wonder, and
quite confounded with delight. She
had been asked to dance by some very
young gentleman, but as she elbowed
her way through the quadrille, she was
still staring right and left with unabated
amazement. Mildred smiled
to herself as she thought that with
the exception of that string of white
tufts round her head, no larger than
beads, which was to pass for a wreath,
she looked for all the world as if some
spirit had suddenly snatched her up
from the pavement of the High Street
of Wimborne, and deposited her in
the ball-room of Brussels. Little did
Mildred imagine that, that crude little
person, absurd, untutored, ridiculous
as she was, would one day have it in
her power to subdue, and torture, and
triumph over her!</p>


<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<p>Mildred was at this moment checked
in her current of observation, and reduced
to play something more than
the part of spectator. Her ear caught
a voice, heard only once before, but
not forgotten; she turned, and saw
the stranger who had surprised her
when, in her girlish days, she was
sitting in the minster tower. He
immediately introduced himself by
asking her to dance.</p>

<p>"I do not dance," she said, but in
a manner which did not seem to refuse
conversation. The stranger appeared
very well satisfied with the
compromise; and some pleasant allusion
to the different nature of the
scene in which they last met, put
them at once upon an easy footing.</p>

<p>"You say you <i>do</i> not dance&mdash;that
is, of course, you <i>will</i> not. I shall
not believe," he continued, "even if
you had just stepped from your high
tower of wisdom, but that you can do
any thing you please to do. Pardon
so blunt a speech."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>can</i>, I think," she replied.
"My uncle, I believe, would have
taught me the broad-sword exercise, if
any one had suggested its utility to
him."</p>

<p>And saying this, she turned to her
uncle, to give him an opportunity, if
he pleased, of joining the conversation.
It was an opportunity which
Mr Bloomfield, who had heard a foreign
language chattered in his ear all
the evening, would have gladly taken;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
but the patience of that gentleman
had been for some time nearly exhausted;
he had taken his sister
under his arm, and was just going to
propose to Mildred to leave the
room.</p>

<p>The stranger escorted them through
the crowd, and saw the ladies into
their carriage.</p>

<p>"Can we set you down any
where?" said Mr Bloomfield, who,
though impatient to be gone, was disposed
to be very cordial towards his
fellow-countryman. "We are at the
<i>Hotel de l'Europe</i>."</p>

<p>"And I opposite at the <i>Hotel de
Flandres</i>&mdash;I will willingly accept your
offer;" and he took the vacant seat
in their carriage.</p>

<p>"How do you like Brussels?" was
on the lips of both gentlemen at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the younger, "I have
been here, I think, the longest; the
question is mine by right of priority
of residence."</p>

<p>Mr Bloomfield was nothing loath to
communicate his impression of all
that he had seen, and especially to
dilate upon a grievance which, it
seemed, had sorely afflicted him.</p>

<p>"As to the town, old and new, and
especially the Grande Place, with its
Hotel de Ville, I have been highly
interested by it; but, my dear sir,
the torture of walking over its horrid
pavement! Only conceive a quiet
old bachelor, slightly addicted to the
gout, accustomed to take his walk
over his well-rolled paths, or on his
own lawn, (if not too damp,) suddenly
put down amongst these cruel stones,
rough and sharp, and pitched together
in mere confusion, to pick his
way how he can, with the chance of
being smashed by some cart or carriage,
for one is turned out on the
same road with the horses. I am
stoned to death, with this only difference,
that I fall upon the stones instead
of the stones falling upon me.
And when there is a pavement&mdash;<i>a
trottoir</i>, as they call it&mdash;it is often so
narrow and slanting, and always so
slippery, and every now and then
broken by some step put there purposely,
it would seem, to overthrow
you, that it is better to bear the penance
at once of the sharp footing in
the centre of the street. <i>Trottoirs</i>, indeed!
I should like to see any one
trot upon them without breaking his
neck! A spider or a black beetle, or
any other creature that crawls upon a
multitude of legs, and has not far to
fall if he stumbles, is the only animal
that is safe upon them. I go moaning
all the day about these jogged
pointed stones, that pitch me from one
to the other with all the malice of
little devils; and, would you believe
it? my niece there only smiles, and
tells me to get thick shoes! They
cannot hurt her; she walks somehow
over the tops of them as if they were
so many balls of Indian rubber, and
has no compassion for her gouty
uncle."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear uncle"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, none at all; indeed you are
not overburdened with that sentiment
at any time for your fellow-travellers.
You bear all the afflictions of the road&mdash;your
own and other people's&mdash;very
calmly."</p>

<p>"Don't mind him, my dear," said
Miss Bloomfield, "he has been exclaiming
again and again what an
excellent traveller you make; nothing
puts you out."</p>

<p>"That is just what I say&mdash;nothing
does put her out. In that she is a
perfect Mephistophiles. You know
the scene of confusion on board a
steamer when it arrives at Antwerp,
and is moored in under the quay on a
hot day, with its full complement of
passengers. There you are baked by
the sun and your own furnaces; stunned
by the jabber around you, and
the abominable roar over your head
made by the escape of the steam;
the deck strewed with baggage, which
is then and there to be publicly examined&mdash;turned
over by the revenue
officers, who leave you to pack up
your things in their original compass,
if you can. Well, in all this scene of
confusion, there sat my niece with her
parasol over her little head, looking
quite composedly at the great cathedral
spires, as if we were not all of us
in a sort of infernal region there."</p>

<p>"No, uncle, I looked every now and
then at our baggage, too, and watched
that interesting process you have described
of its examination. And when
the worthy officer was going to crush
aunt's bonnet by putting your dressing-case
on the top of it, I rose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
arrested him. I had my hand upon
his arm. He thought I was going to
take him prisoner of war, for he was
about to put his hand to his sword;
but a second look at his enemy reassured
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did squeak when the bonnets
were touched," cried the uncle,
"I am glad of that: it shows that
you have some human, at least some
feminine, feeling in your composition."</p>

<p>"But <i>àpropos</i> of the pavement,"
said the young stranger, who could
not join the uncle in this banter on his
niece, and was therefore glad to
get back to some common ground.
"I took up, in a reading-room, the
other day, a little pamphlet on phrenology,
by <i>M. Victor Idjiez</i>, <i>Fondateur
du Musée Phrenologique</i> at Brussels.
It might as well have been entitled,
on animal magnetism, for he is one of
those who set the whole man in motion&mdash;mind
and body both&mdash;by electricity.
Amongst other things, he has
discovered that that singular strength
which madmen often display in their
fits, is merely a galvanic power which
they draw (owing, I suppose, to the
peculiar state of their nerves,) from
the common reservoir the earth, and
which, consequently, forsakes them
when they are properly isolated. In
confirmation of this theory, he gives
a singular <i>fact</i> from a Brussels journal,
showing that <i>asphalte pavement</i>
will isolate the individual. A madman
had contrived to make his escape
from confinement, having first thrown
all the furniture of his room out of the
window, and knocked down and
trampled upon his keeper. Off he
ran, and no one would venture to stop
him. A corporal and four soldiers
were brought up to the attack:
he made nothing of them; after having
beaten the four musketeers, he
took the corporal by the leg and again
ran off, dragging him after upon the
ground. A crowd of work-people
emerging from a factory met him in
full career with the corporal behind
him, and undertook his capture. All
who approached him were immediately
thrown down&mdash;scattered over the
plain. But his triumph was suddenly
checked; he lighted upon a piece of
asphalte pavement. The moment he
put his foot upon it, his strength deserted
him, and he was seized and
taken prisoner. The instant, however,
he stepped off the pavement, his
strength revived, and he threw his
assailants from him with the same
ease as before. And thus it continued:
whenever he got off the pavement, his
strength was restored to him; the
moment he touched it, he was again
captured with facility. The asphalte
had completely isolated him."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" cried Mr Bloomfield;
"the fellow, after all, was not quite
so mad as not to know what he was
about. A Brussels pavement, asphalte
or not, is no place for a wrestling
match. Isolated, indeed! Oh, doubtless,
it would isolate you most completely&mdash;at
least the soles of your
feet&mdash;from all communication with
the earth. But does Mr&mdash;what do
you call him?&mdash;proceed to theorise
upon such <i>facts</i> as these?"</p>

<p>"You shall have another of them.
Speaking of animal magnetism or
electricity, he says&mdash;'There are certain
patients the iron nails of whose
shoes will fly out if they are laid in a
direction due north.'"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>"But you are quoting from Baron
Munchausen."</p>

<p>"Not precisely."</p>

<p>Miss Bloomfield, who had been
watching her opportunity, here brought
in her contribution. "Pray, sir, do
you believe the story they tell of the
architect of the Hotel de Ville&mdash;that
he destroyed himself on finding, after
he had built it, that the tower was
not in the centre?"</p>

<p>"That the architect should not discover
that till the building was finished,
is indeed <i>too good a story to be
true</i>."</p>

<p>"But, then, why make the man
kill himself? Something must have
happened; something must be true."</p>

<p>"Why, madam, there was, no
doubt, a committee of taste in those
days as in ours. They destroyed the
plan of the architect by cutting short
one of his wings, or prolonging the
other; and he, out of vexation, destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">[721]</a></span>
himself. This is the only
explanation that occurs to me. A
committee of taste is always, in one
sense at least, the death of the artist."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Mildred; "the
artist can be no longer said to exist,
if he is not allowed, in his own sphere,
to be supreme."</p>

<p>This brought them to the door of
the hotel. They separated.</p>

<p>The next morning, on returning
from their walk, the ladies found a
card upon their table which simply
bore the name of "Alfred Winston."
The gentleman who called with it, the
waiter said, had left word that he
regretted he was about to quit Brussels,
that evening, for Paris.</p>

<p>Mildred read the name several
times&mdash;Alfred Winston. And this
was all she knew of him&mdash;the name
upon this little card!</p>

<p>There were amongst the trio several
discussions as to who or what Mr
Alfred Winston might be. Miss
Bloomfield pronounced him to be an
artist, from his caustic observations
on committees of taste, and their
meddling propensities. Mr Bloomfield,
on the contrary, surmised he
was a literary man; for who but such
a one would think of occupying himself
in a reading-room with a pamphlet
on phrenology, instead of the
newspapers? And all ended in "wondering
if they should fall upon him
again?"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE LAW AND ITS PUNISHMENTS.</h2>


<p>It is no uncommon boast in the mouth
of Englishmen, that the system of jurisprudence
under which they have the
happiness to live, is the most perfect
the world has ever seen. Having its
foundation in those cabalistic words,
"Nullus liber homo," &amp;c., engraved
with an iron pen upon the tablets of
the constitution by the barons of King
John, the criminal law, in their estimation,
has been steadily improved
by the wisdom of successive ages,
until, in the present day, it has reached
a degree of excellence which it were
rashness to suppose can by any human
sagacity be surpassed. Under its protecting
influence, society reposes in
security; under its just, but merciful
administration, the accused finds every
facility for establishing his innocence,
and is allowed the benefit of every
doubt that ingenuity can suggest to
rebut the probability of guilt; before
its sacred tribunals, the weak and the
powerful, the poor and the rich, stand
in complete equality; under its impartial
sentence, all who merit punishment
are alike condemned, without
respect of any antecedents of rank,
wealth, or station. In such a system,
no change can take place without injury,
for it is (not to speak irreverently)
a system of perfection.</p>

<p>This is the dream of many&mdash;for we
must characterise it rather as a dream
than a deliberate conviction. Reason,
we fear, has but little to do with the
opinions of those who hold that English
jurisprudence has no need of reform.</p>

<p>The praises which are so lavishly
bestowed upon our criminal law may
be, to a great extent, just; but it is
to be doubted whether they are altogether
judicious. It is true, that in no
other system of jurisprudence throughout
the civilised world, or among the
nations of antiquity, has there existed,
or is there so tender a regard for the
rights of the accused. In Germany,
the wretch who falls under suspicion
of the law is subjected to a tedious
and inquisitorial examination, with
a view to elicit from his own lips
the proof, and even the confession of
guilt. This mental torture, not to
speak of the imprisonment of the body,
may be protracted for years, and even
for life. In France, the facts connected
with an offence are published
by authority, and circulated throughout
the country, to be greedily devoured
by innumerable lovers of unwholesome
excitement; and not the
simple facts alone, but a thousand incidental
circumstances connected with
the transaction, together with the
birth, parentage, and education, and
all the previous life of the supposed
offender, making in the whole a romance
of considerable interest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>
possessing an attraction beyond the
ordinary tales which fill the <i>feuilleton</i>
of a newspaper. In England, the position
of the accused is widely different.
We avoid the errors and the
tyranny of our neighbours; but have
we not fallen into the opposite extreme?
Our magistrates scrupulously
caution prisoners not to say any thing
that may criminate themselves. Every
thing that authority can effect by
means of advice, which, under the circumstances,
is equivalent to command,
is carefully brought forward to prevent
a confession. And if, in spite of
checks, warnings, and commands, the
accused, overcome by the pangs of
conscience, and urged by an irresistible
impulse to disburden his soul of
guilt, should perchance confess, the
testimony is sometimes rejected upon
some technical point of law, which
would seem to have been established
for the express purpose of defeating
the ends of justice. Indeed, the technicalities
which surround our legal
tribunals have been, until very lately,
and are still, in too many instances,
most strangely favourable to the escape
of criminals. The idlest quibbles,
most offensive to common sense, and
utterly disgraceful in a court of criminal
investigation, have at various
times been allowed as valid pleas in
defence of the most palpable crimes.
Many a thief has escaped, on the
ground of some slight and immaterial
misdescription of the stolen article,
such as a horse instead of a mare, a
cow instead of an ox, a sheep for a
ewe, and so on. True, these absurdities
exist no longer; but others still
remain, less ridiculous perhaps, but
not less obstructive of the course of
justice, and quite as pernicious in their
example. Great and beneficial changes
have been effected in the criminal
code, and too much praise cannot be
bestowed upon Sir Robert Peel for his
exertions in this behalf. To her Majesty's
commissioners, also, some thanks
are due for the labour they have expended
with a view to the consolidation
and subsequent codification of the
various statutes. Their labours, however,
have not hitherto been very
largely productive. The excellent
object of simplifying our criminal laws
still remains to be accomplished, and
so long as it does so, so long will it
be obnoxious to the censures which
are not unsparingly heaped upon it.</p>

<p>But if our jurisprudence be in one
respect too favourable to the criminal,
in another, as it appears to us, the
balance is more than restored to its
equilibrium. If, in the process of investigation,
justice leans too much to
the side of mercy, the inquiry once
over, she quickly repents of her excessive
leniency, and is careful to justify
her ways by a rigorous severity.
The accused, if he is not lucky enough
to avail himself of the thousand avenues
of escape that are open during
the progress of his trial, must abandon
all hope of further consideration, and
look to undergo a punishment, of
which the full extent cannot be estimated
by any human sagacity. Once
condemned, he ceases to be an object
of care or solicitude, except so far as
these are necessary to preserve his
life and restrain his liberty. Through
crime he has forfeited all claim upon
the fostering care of the state. He is
an alien and an outcast, and has no
pretence for expecting any thing but
misery.</p>

<p>Surely there is something vindictive
in all this&mdash;something not quite
consistent with the calm and unimpassioned
administration of justice.
The first impressions of any man of
ordinary humanity must be very much
against a system which fosters and
encourages such a state of things.
We believe that those first impressions
would be confirmed by inquiry;
and it is our purpose in the present
article briefly to state the reasons for
our belief.</p>

<p>The treatment of criminals under
sentence of imprisonment must now
be well known to the public. Repeated
discussion and innumerable writings
have rendered it familiar to every body.
A man is condemned to undergo, let
us say, three years' incarceration in a
jail. A portion of the time is to be
spent in hard labour. He commences
his imprisonment with no other earthly
object than to get through it with the
least possible amount of suffering.
Employment, which might, under
better circumstances, be a pleasant
resource, is distasteful to him because
it is compulsory, and because it is
productive of no benefit to himself.
The hours that are unemployed are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
passed in company with others as bad
as, or worse than, himself. They amuse
themselves by recounting the history
of their lives, their hairbreadth escapes,
their successful villanies. Each profits
by the experience of the whole number,
and stores it in his memory for
future guidance. Every good impulse
is checked, and every better feeling
stifled in the birth. There is no
room in a jail for the growth of
virtue; the atmosphere is not congenial
to its development. The prisoner,
however well disposed, cannot choose
but listen to the debasing talk of those
with whom he is compelled to associate.
Should he resist the wicked
influence for a while, he can hardly
do so long. The poison will work.
By little and little it insinuates itself
into the mind, and vitiates all the
springs of good. In the end, he yields
to the irresistible force of continued
bad example, and becomes as bad as
the worst.</p>

<p>But let us believe, for an instant,
that one prisoner has resisted the ill
effects of wicked association&mdash;let us
suppose him to have escaped the contamination
of a jail, to have received
no moral hurt from bad example, to
be untainted by the corrupting atmosphere
of congregated vice&mdash;in short,
to return into the world at the end of
his imprisonment a better man than
he was at its commencement. Let
us suppose all this, although the supposition,
it must be confessed, is unsupported
by experience, and directly
in the teeth of probability. He sallies
forth from his prison, full of good
resolutions, and determined to win
the character of an honest man. Perhaps
he has a small sum of money,
which helps him to reach a part of
the country most distant from the
scene of his disgrace. He seeks for
work, and is fortunate enough to
obtain it. For a short time, all goes
well with him. He is industrious
and sober, and gains the good-will of
his employer. He is confirmed in his
good intentions, and fancies that his
hopes of regaining his position in
society are about to be realised. Vain
hopes! Rumour is busy with his
name. His fellow-labourers begin to
look coldly on him. The master does
not long remain in ignorance. The
discharged convict is taxed with his
former degradation, and made to suffer
again the consequences of a crime he
has well and fully expiated. His brief
hour of prosperity is over. He is cast
forth again upon the world, denied the
means of gaining an honest livelihood,
with nothing before him but starvation
or a jail. What wonder should
he choose the latter! Goaded by
despair, or stimulated by hunger, he
yields to the first temptation, and
commits a crime which places him
again within prison walls. It is his
second conviction. He is a marked
man. He were more than mortal if
he escaped the deteriorating effects of
repeated association with the hardened
and the vicious. His future career is
certain. He falls from bad to worse,
and ends his life upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>We have imagined, for the sake of
argument, a case which, in one of its
features, is unfortunately of very rare
occurrence. Criminals seldom, perhaps
never, leave a jail with the slightest
inclination to a course of honesty.
Their downward progress, when they
have once been exposed to the contamination
of a prison life, may be calculated
almost with certainty. No
sooner is the term of their imprisonment
expired, than they step forth into the
world, eager to recommence the old career
of systematic villany. Good intentions,
and the desire of doing well, are
almost always strangers to their breasts.
But should they, perchance, be alive
to better things, and be moved by
wholesome impulses, what an awful
responsibility rests upon those who,
by individual acts, or by a pernicious
system, check and render abortive the
efforts of a dawning virtue! In the
case we have supposed, there is doubtless
much that must be laid to the
score of human nature. Men will not
easily be persuaded, that he who has
once made a grievous lapse from the
path of honesty, will not be ever
prone to repeat the offence. None
but the truly charitable (an infinitesimal
portion of every community)
will expose themselves to the risk of
employing a discharged convict. But
whilst this much evil is justly attributed
to the selfish cruelty of society,
a much larger share of blame attaches
to the system which affords too plausible
a pretext for such uncharitable
conduct. It is not merely because a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
man has offended against the laws, and
been guilty of what, in legal parlance,
may be a simple misdemeanour, that
he is regarded with suspicion and
treated with ignominy; but much
more, because he has been confined in
a jail, and exposed to all the pernicious
influences which are known to
be rife within its walls. It is deemed
a thing incredible, that a man can
issue from a hot-bed of corruption, and
not be himself corrupt. To have undergone
a term of imprisonment, is very
generally thought to be equivalent to
taking a degree in infamy. On the
system, therefore, rests much of the
blame which would otherwise attach
to the world's cold charity; to its
account must be charged every subject
who might have been saved, and
who, through despair, is lost to the
service of the state.</p>

<p>The evils we have described are
patent and notorious; the only question,
therefore, that arises is, whether
they are inevitable and inherent in
the nature of things, or whether they
may be avoided by greater care and
an improved system. Before entering
upon this question, it may
be well to notice briefly the various
opinions that are entertained concerning
the proper end and aim of
criminal punishment. We take for
granted, that in every community,
under whatever political constitution
it may exist and be associated, the
sole object of criminal <i>law</i> is the peace
and security of society. With regard
to the means by which this object may
be best attained, or, in other words,
with regard to the whole system of
jurisprudence, from a preventive police
down to the discipline of jails and the
machinery of the scaffold, a great
diversity of sentiment must naturally
be expected. The pure theorist and
the subtle disciple of Paley, maintain
that the proper, nay, the sole object
of punishment should be the prevention
of crime. The philanthropic enthusiast,
and the man of strict religious
feeling, reject all other motives save
only that of reforming the criminal.
The dispassionate inquirer, the practical
man, and he who has learned his
lessons in the school of experience,
take a middle course, though inclining
a little to the theory of Paley.
They hold that, whilst the amount,
and to some extent the quality, of
punishment should be settled and defined
chiefly with a view to prevent
the increase of crime by the deterring
effect of fear, yet the details ought, if
possible, to be so managed as in the
end to bring about the reformation of
the prisoner. We have no hesitation in
avowing, that this last opinion is our
own. There is an argument in its
favour, which the most rigid disciple
of the pure "prevention" theory
must recognise immediately as one of
his own most valued weapons. The
"peace and security of society" are
his watchwords. They are ours also.
But whilst, in his opinion, the only
way to produce the desired result is
by a system of terrorism, such as will
deter from the perpetration of crime,
we believe that a careful solicitude
concerning the moral conduct of the
criminal during his imprisonment, and
an anxious endeavour to instruct and
improve his mind, by enforcing good
habits, and taking away bad example,
would be found equally powerful in
their operation upon the well-being of
society. For although it is a lamentable
fact, that the number of our criminals
is always being kept up to its full
complement, by the addition of juvenile
offenders, so that it would be vain
to indulge a hope, without cutting off the
feeding-springs, of materially diminishing
our criminal population; yet it
is equally true that the most desperate
and dangerous offenders are they who
have served their apprenticeship in
jails, and there accomplished themselves
in all the various devices of
ingenious wickedness. It is these
who give the deepest shade to the
calendar of crime, and work incalculable
mischief both in and out of
prison, by instructing the tyros
in all the most subtle varieties of
villany. To reform such men may
seem an arduous, perhaps an impossible
task; but it is far less arduous, and
certainly not impossible, to prevent
their becoming the hardened ruffians
which we have, without exaggeration,
described them.</p>

<p>The truth must be told. The system
of secondary punishments (as they are
called, though why we know not) is
radically wrong. There is something
radically wrong in the discipline and
regulations of our jails. The details of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
imprisonment are faulty and imperfect.
Surely this is proved, when it is shown
that men are invariably rendered
worse, instead of better, by confinement
in a jail. Even though it be
admitted, for the sake of argument,
that the state lies under no obligation
to attempt the reformation of its criminals,
the admission serves no whit
to support a system under which criminals
are confirmed and hardened in
their vicious courses. The state may
refuse to succour, but it has no right
to injure. This, as it seems to us, is
the strong point against our present
system. It does not so much punish
the body as injure the mind of the
criminal; and, in so doing, it eventually
endangers rather than secures
the peace of society.</p>

<p>Many remedies have been proposed,
but all, with an exception that will presently
be mentioned, are rather palliative
than corrective. Solitary confinement,
for instance, is an undoubted cure
for the diseases engendered by bad example
and evil communications; but
it breeds a host of other diseases,
peculiar to itself, and in many cases
worse than those it cures. Not to
speak of the indulgence which so much
idleness allows for vicious thoughts
and recollections, the chief objection
to solitary confinement is, that, if
continued for any length of time, it
unfits a man wholly for subsequent
intercourse with the world. He leaves
his prison with a mind prostrated to
imbecility, and a body reduced to
utter helplessness; yet he retains,
perhaps, the cunning of the idiot, and
just sufficient use of his limbs to serve
him for a bad purpose. On these
painful considerations, however, it is
unnecessary to dwell at length. Solitary
confinement, without occupation
and without intervals of society, was
an experiment upon the human animal.
It has been tried in this country
and elsewhere, and has signally failed.
At this moment, we believe, it has few
or no supporters.</p>

<p>The plan which has most largely
and most deservedly attracted public
attention, is that of Captain Maconochie,
known by the name of the "Mark
System." Captain Maconochie was
superintendent of the penal establishment
at Norfolk Island, where he had
constantly about 2000 prisoners under
his command. This office he held for
eight years, and had, consequently,
the most favourable opportunity of
observing the practical working of the
old system. Finding it to be defective,
and injurious in every particular,
he tried, with certain unavoidable modifications,
a plan of his own, which,
as he asserts, succeeded beyond his
expectation. Having thus proved its
practicability in Norfolk Island, and
satisfied himself of its advantages, he
wishes now to introduce it into England;
and, with a view of obtaining
a favourable hearing and efficient support,
he has procured it to be referred
to a committee of the "Society for
Promoting the Amendment of the
Law." The committee have reported
in its favour; and their report, which
is said to have been drawn up by the
learned Recorder of Birmingham, contains
so concise and clear a statement
of the Captain's plan, that we take
leave to extract a portion of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Maconochie's plan," says
Mr M. D. Hill, "had its origin in
his experience of the evil tendency of
sentences for a time certain, and of
fixed gratuitous jail rations of food.
These he practically found opposed to
the reformation of the criminal. A
man under a time-sentence looks exclusively
to the means of beguiling
that time. He is thereby led to evade
labour, and to seek opportunities of
personal gratification, obtained, in extreme
cases, even in ways most horrible.
His powers of deception are
sharpened for the purpose; and even,
when unable to offend in act, he seeks
in fancy a gratification, by gloating
over impure images. At the best,
his life stagnates, no proper object of
pursuit being presented to his thoughts.
And the allotment of fixed gratuitous
rations, irrespective of conduct or exertion,
further aggravates the evil, by
removing even the minor stimulus to
action, furnished by the necessity of
procuring food, and by thus directly
fostering those habits of improvidence
which, perhaps even more than determined
vice, lead to crime.</p>

<p>"In lieu of sentences to imprisonment
or transportation, measured thus
by months or years, Captain Maconochie
recommends sentences to an
amount of labour, measured by a given
number of marks, to be placed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
debit of the convict, in books to be
kept for the purpose. This debit to be
from time to time increased by charges
made in the same currency, for all
supplies of food and clothing, and by
any fines that may be imposed for
misconduct. The duration of his sentence
will thus be made to depend on
three circumstances. <i>First</i>, The gravity
of the original offence, or the
estimate made by the judge of the
amount of discipline which the criminal
ought to undergo before he is restored
to liberty. This regulates the
amount of the original debit. <i>Second</i>,
The zeal, industry, and effectiveness
of his labour in the works allotted
to him, which furnish him with the
means of payment, or of adding from
time to time to the credit side of his
account. And, <i>Third</i>, His conduct in
confinement. If well conducted, he
will avoid fines; and if economical in
food, and such other gratifications as
he is permitted to purchase with his
marks, he will keep down the amount
of his debits.</p>

<p>"By these means, Captain Maconochie
contends, that a term of imprisonment
may be brought to bear a
close resemblance to adversity in ordinary
life, which, being deeply felt,
is carefully shunned; but which, nevertheless,
when encountered in a manful
spirit, improves and elevates the
character. All the objects of punishment
will be thus attained. There
will be continued destitution, unless
relief is sought by exertion, and hence
there will be labour and suffering;
but, with exertion, there will be not
only the hope, but the certainty of recovery&mdash;whence
there will be improvement
in good habits, and right
thinking. And the motives put into
operation to produce effort and economy,
being also of the same character
with those in ordinary life, will advantageously
prepare the prisoner for
their wholesome action on him after
his discharge.</p>

<p>"The only other very distinctive
feature in Captain Maconochie's system
is, his proposal that, after the
prisoner has passed through a term of
probation, to be measured not by
lapse of time, but by his conduct as
indicated by the state of his account,
he shall be advanced from separate
confinement into a social state. For
this purpose, he shall become a member
of a small class of six or eight,
these classes being capable of being
separated from each other, just as individuals
are separated from individuals
during the earlier stage, the
members of each class to have a
common interest, the marks earned
or lost by each to count to the gain
or loss of his party, not of himself
exclusively. By this means, Captain
Maconochie thinks prisoners will be
rescued from the simply gregarious
state of existence, which is, in truth,
a selfish one, now incident to imprisonment
in those jails to which
the separate system is not applied,
and will be raised into a social existence.
Captain Maconochie is convinced,
by experience, that much good
feeling will be elicited among them in
consequence of this change. Indolence
and vice, which either prevent
the prisoner from earning, or compel
him to forfeit his marks, will become
unpopular in the community; and industry
and good conduct, as enabling
him to acquire and preserve them, will,
on the contrary, obtain for him its approbation.
On much experience, he
asserts that no portion of his <i>modus
operandi</i> is more effective than this,
by which, even in the depraved community
of Norfolk Island, he succeeded,
in a wonderfully short time, in giving
an upward direction to the public
opinion of the class of prisoners themselves."</p>

<p>This brief outline of the Mark
System undoubtedly presents to view
one of the boldest projects of reform
that ever proceeded from a private
individual. It seeks to root up and
utterly annihilate the whole system
of secondary punishments, and necessarily
involves a radical change in
the criminal law. To a plan of so
sweeping a character, a thousand objections
will of course be made. Some
will deny the necessity of so fundamental
a change. Many will be startled
by the magnitude of the innovation
alone, and refuse at the very
outset to accept a proposition which,
whatever be its intrinsic merits,
presents itself to their imagination
surrounded with incalculable perils.
Others will shake their heads, and
doubt the possibility of working out a
problem, which, from the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span>
time, has baffled the ingenuity of man.
A few there may be, who will regard
the new system with a favourable
eye, albeit on no other ground than
because it offers a prospect of escape
from evils which exist, and are increasing,
and which can hardly be
exchanged for worse. For want of
better companions, we shall take our
position in the last-mentioned class;
confessing that there is much in Captain
Maconochie's system which seems
at present Utopian, and savours too
strongly of an enthusiasm which can
see none but its own colours, but deeply
impressed, at the same time, with
the plausibility of his general theory.
It is vain to hope that the unaided
efforts of the chaplain will ever reform
the inmates of a jail. No man was
ever yet preached into good habits,
except by a miracle. It is vain to
hope that a discipline (if such it can
be called) which enforces sometimes
idleness, and sometimes useless labour,
providing at the same time for all the
wants of the body, with an abundance
never enjoyed beyond the prison walls,
will ever make men industrious, or
frugal, or any thing else than dissolute
and idle. In short, it is vain to hope,
in the present state of things, that
the criminal population of these kingdoms
will ever be diminished, or even
checked in its steady tendency to increase.
If, then, all these hopes, which
are exactly such as a philanthropist
may reasonably indulge, be vain and
futile, no man would be open to a
charge of folly, should he embrace any,
even the wildest proposition that holds
out the prospect of improvement.</p>

<p>Captain Maconochie's system may
be divided into two distinct and very
different parts; namely, the general
principles and the details. Concerning
the latter, we are unwilling to hazard
an opinion, deeming them peculiarly
a matter of experiment, and incapable
of proof or refutation by any other
test than experience. But principles
are universal, and, if true, may always
be supported by argument, and
strengthened by discussion; those of
the Mark System, we think, will bear
the application of both. No one possessed
of the smallest experience of
the human mind, will deny that it is
utterly impossible to inculcate and fix
good habits by a process which is
continually distasteful to the patient.
With regard to labour, which is compulsory
and unproductive, the labourer,
so far from becoming habituated to
it, loathes it the more the longer he
is obliged to continue it. Such labour,
moreover, has no good effect upon the
mind; it produces nothing but disgust
and discontent. A similar result is
produced upon the body under similar
circumstances. Exercise is only beneficial
when taken with a good will,
and enjoyed with a zest: a man who
should walk but two or three miles,
grumbling all the way, would be as
tired at the end as though he had
walked twenty in a more contented
mood. What, then, will some one
say, are prisoners not to be punished
at all? Is every thing to be made
easy to them, and ingenuity taxed
for devices to render their sentences
agreeable, and to take the sting from
imprisonment? The answer is ready.
The law is not vindictive, and does
not pretend to inflict suffering beyond
what is necessary for the security of
society. The thief and the homicide
cannot be allowed to go at large.
They must either be sent out of the
country, or shut up within it. By
some means or other, they must be
deprived of the power of inflicting
further injury upon their fellow-creatures.
But how long are they to be
cut off from the world? For a time
fixed and irrevocable, and irrespective
of subsequent good conduct, or reformation
of character, or any other
consideration than only the magnitude
of the original offence? Surely neither
reason nor humanity can approve such
a doctrine; for does it not, in fact,
involve the very principle which our
law repudiates, namely, the principle
that its punishments are vindictive?
If a man who steals a horse, and is
condemned to three years' imprisonment,
be compelled to undergo the
whole sentence, without reference to
his conduct under confinement, this
surely is vengeance, and not, what it
assumes to be, a punishment proportioned
to the necessity of the case.
It is, no doubt, proper that a criminal
should be condemned to suffer some
loss of liberty, more or less, according
to the nature of his delinquency, and
a minimum should always be fixed;
but it seems equally proper, and consistent
with acknowledged principles,
that a power should reside somewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
of diminishing the maximum, and
where more advantageously than in
the criminal himself? If the motives
which govern the world at large, and
operate upon men in ordinary life, to
make them frugal and industrious, and
to keep them honest, can be brought
to bear upon the isolated community
of a jail, why should they not? The
object is humane; not injurious, but,
on the contrary, highly beneficial to
society; and not opposed to any established
rule of law or general policy.
We can conceive no possible argument
against it, save that which we have
already noticed, and, we trust, satisfactorily.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice, as being
calculated to satisfy the scruples of
those who may be alarmed at the
introduction of what they imagine a
novel principle into our criminal jurisprudence,
that this, the main feature
of the Mark System, is not new. It
is sanctioned by long usage in our
penal settlements. In the Australian
colonies, a man under sentence of
transportation for years or for life
may, by his own conduct, both shorten
the duration and mitigate the severity
of his punishment. By industry, by
a peaceable demeanour, by the exercise
of skill and ingenuity acquired in
better times, he may obtain advantages
which are not accorded to
others. By a steady continuance in
such behaviour, he may acquire the
privilege of working for himself, and
enjoying the produce of his labour.
In the end, he may even be rewarded
by a free pardon. If all these things
may be done in Australia, why not
also in England? Surely there is more
to be said on behalf of convicts sentenced
to imprisonment than for those
sentenced to transportation. If our
sympathy, or, to speak more correctly,
our mercy, is to be inversely to the
enormity of the offence, then the
English prisoner is most entitled to
our regard. It is possible that the
transportation system may be wrong,
but, at least, let us be consistent.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that Captain
Maconochie's plan should be adopted
<i>in extenso</i>, to the immediate and active
subversion of the ancient system. We
may feel our way. There is no reason
why a single prison should not be set
apart, or, if necessary, specially constructed,
for the purpose of applying
the test of practice to the new theory.
A short act might be passed, empowering
the judges to inflict labour
instead of time-sentences&mdash;of course,
within a certain limit as to number.
Captain Maconochie himself might be
entrusted with the superintendence of
the experiment, in order to avoid the
possibility of a suspicion that it had
not received a fair trial. If, with every
reasonable advantage, the scheme
should eventually prove impracticable,
then, of course, it will sink into oblivion,
and be consigned to the limbo
of impossible theories. The country
will have sustained no loss, save the
insignificant expense of the model
machinery.</p>

<p>Considering the whole subject&mdash;its
importance, its difficulty, the novelty
of the proposed amendments, and
their magnitude&mdash;we are disposed to
agree with the learned Recorder of
Birmingham, that "the plan is highly
deserving of notice." Objections, of
course, might be made in abundance,
over and above those we have thought
proper to notice. These, however,
may be all reduced to one, namely,
that the scheme is impracticable. That
it may prove so, we do not deny; nor
could any one, with a grain of prudence,
venture to deny it, seeing how
many promising projects are daily
failing, not through their own intrinsic
defects, but through miscalculation of
opposing forces. The test of the
Mark System, we repeat, must be
experience. All that we seek to
establish in its favour is the soundness
of its principles. Of these we
do not hesitate to avow a perfect
approval; and, in doing so, we do not
fear being classed among the disciples
of the new school of pseudo-philanthropy,
whose academy is Exeter
Hall, and whose teachers are such
men as Lord Nugent and Mr Fox.
It is quite possible to feel compassion
for the guilty, and a solicitude
for their temporal as well as eternal
welfare, without elevating them into
the dignity of martyrs, and fixing one's
attention upon them, to the neglect of
their more honest and less protected
neighbours. It is no uncommon thing
to hear comparisons drawn between
the conditions of the prisoner and the
pauper&mdash;between the abundant nourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
food of the former, and the
scanty meagre rations of the latter!
There is no doubt that better fare is
provided in a jail than in a workhouse.
Good reasons, perhaps, may
be given for the distinction, but in
appearance it is horribly unjust. No
system which proposed to encourage
it would ever receive our approbation.
The Mark System is adverse to the
pampering of criminals. It seeks to
enforce temperance and frugality, both
by positive rewards, and by punishing
gluttony and indulgence. Its object
is the improvement, not of the physical,
but the moral condition of the
prisoner. His mind, not his body, is
its especial care&mdash;a prudent, humane,
we will even say, a pious care! Visionary
it may be, though we think not&mdash;absurd
it can never be, except in the
eyes of those to whom the well-being
of their fellow-creatures is matter of
indifference, and who, too frivolous to
reflect, or too shallow to penetrate
the depths of things, seek to disguise
their ignorance and folly under cover of
ridicule. To such we make no appeal.
But to the many really humane and
sensible persons who are alive to the
importance of the subject, we recommend
a deliberate examination of the
Mark System.</p>

<h2>LAYS AND LEGENDS OF THE THAMES.</h2>


<p>Never was there such a summer
on this side of the Tropics. How
is it possible to exist, with the
thermometer up to boiling point!
London a vast caldron&mdash;the few
people left in its habitable parts
strongly resembling stewed fish&mdash;the
aristocratic portion of the world flying
in all directions, though there are
three horticultural fetes to come&mdash;the
attachés to all the foreign embassies
sending in their resignations, rather
than be roasted alive&mdash;the ambassadors
all on leave, in the direction of
the North Pole&mdash;the new governor
of Canada congratulated, for the first
time in national history, on his banishment
to a land where he has nine
months winter;&mdash;and a contract just
entered into with the Wenham Lake
Company for ten thousand tons of
ice, to rescue the metropolis from a
general conflagration.</p>

<p>&mdash;Went to dine with the new East
India Director, in his Putney paradise.
Sir Charles gives dinners worthy
of the Mogul, and he wants nothing
of the pomps and pleasures of the
East but a harem. But, in the mean
time, he gathers round him a sort of
human menagerie; and every race of
man, from the Hottentot to the Highlander,
is to be found feeding in his
Louis Quatorze saloons.</p>

<p>This certainly variegates the scene
considerably, and relieves us of the
intolerable topics, of Parliament, taxes,
the last attempt on Louis Philippe,
the last adventure of Queen Christina,
or the last good thing of the last great
bore of Belgrave Square; with the
other desperate expedients to avoid
the inevitable yawn. We had an Esquimaux
chief, who, however, dwelt
too long on the luxury of porpoise
steaks; a little plump Mandarin, who
indulged us with the tricks of the tea
trade; the sheik Ben Hassan Ben
Ali, who had narrowly escaped hanging
by the hands of the French; and
a New Zealand chief, strongly suspected
of habits inconsistent with the
European <i>cuisine</i>, yet who restricted
himself on this occasion to every thing
at the table.</p>

<p>At length, in a pause of the conversation,
somebody asked where
somebody else was going, for the dog-days.
The question engaged us all.
But, on comparing notes, every Englishman
of the party had been everywhere
already&mdash;Cairo, Constantinople,
Calcutta, Cape Horn. There
was not a corner of the world, where
they had not drunk tea, smoked
cigars, and anathematised the country,
the climate, and the constitution.
Every thing was <i>usé</i>&mdash;every soul was
<i>blasé</i>. There was no hope of novelty,
except by an Artesian perforation
to the centre, or a voyage to the
moon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span></p>

<p>At last a curious old personage,
with a nondescript visage, and who
might, from the jargon of his tongue
and the mystery of his costume, have
been a lineal descendant of the Wandering
Jew, asked, had any one at
table seen the Thames?</p>

<p>The question struck us all at once.
It was a grand discovery; it was a
flash of light; it was the birth of a
new idea; it was an influx of brilliant
inquiry. It was ascertained, that
though we had all steamed up and
down the Thames times without number,
not one of us had seen the river.
Some had always steamed it in their
sleep; some had plunged at once into
the cabin, to avoid the passengers on
deck; some had escaped the vision
by the clouds of a cigar; some by a
French novel and an English dinner.
But not one could recollect any thing
more of it than it flowed through
banks more or less miry; that it was,
to the best of their recollection, something
larger than the Regent's Canal;
and some thought that they had seen
occasional masts and smoke flying by
them.</p>

<p>My mind was made up on the spot.
Novelty is my original passion&mdash;the
spring of all my virtues and vices&mdash;the
stimulant of all my desires, disasters,
and distinctions. In short, I
determined to see the Thames.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rose at daybreak&mdash;the sky blue,
the wind fragrant, Putney throwing
up its first faint smokes; the villa all
asleep. Leaving a billet for Sir Charles,
I ordered my cab, and set off for the
Thames. "How little," says Jonathan
Swift, "does one-half of the world
know what the other is doing." I had
left Putney the abode of silence, a
solitary policeman standing here and
there, like the stork which our modern
painters regularly put into the
corner of their landscapes to express
the sublime of solitude&mdash;no slipshod
housemaid peeping from her window;
no sight or sound of life to be seen
through the rows of the flower-pots,
or the lattices of the suburb gardens.</p>

<p>But, once in London, what a contrast.
From the foot of London bridge
what a rush of life; what an incursion
of cabs; what a rattle of waggons;
what a surge of population; what a
chaos of clamour; what volcanic volumes
of everlasting smoke rolling up
against the unhappy face of the Adelaide
hotel; what rushing of porters,
and trundling of trunks; what
cries of every species, utterable by
that extraordinary machine the throat
of man; what solicitations to trust
myself, for instant conveyance to the
remotest shore of the terraqueous
globe!&mdash;"For Calais, sir? Boat off
in half-an-hour."&mdash;"For Constantinople?
in a quarter."&mdash;"For Alexandria?
in five minutes."&mdash;"For the
Cape? bell just going to ring." In
this confusion of tongues it was a
thousand to one that I had not jumped
into the boat for the Niger, and before
I recovered my senses, been far on my
way to Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>In a feeling little short of desperation,
or of that perplexity in which
one labours to decypher the possible
purport of a maiden speech, I flung
myself into the first steamer which I
could reach, and, to my genuine self-congratulation,
found that I was under
no compulsion to be carried beyond
the mouth of the Thames.</p>

<p>I had now leisure to look round me.
The bell had not yet chimed: passengers
were dropping in. Carriages
were still rolling down to the landing-place,
laden with mothers and daughters,
lapdogs and bandboxes, innumerable.
The surrounding scenery
came, as the describers say, "in all its
power on my eyes."&mdash;St Magnus, built
by Sir Christopher Wren, as dingy
and massive as if it had been built by
Roderic the Goth; St Olave's, rising
from its ruins, as fresh as a fairy palace
of gingerbread; the Shades,
where men drink wine, as Bacchus
did, from the bunghole; the Bridge of
Bridges, clambered over and crowded
with spectators as thick as hiving bees!</p>

<p>But&mdash;prose was never made for
such things. I must be Pindaric.</p>

<p>The charming author of that most
charming of all brochures, <i>Le Voyage
autour de ma Chambre</i>, says, that the
less a man has to write about, the
better he writes. But this charming
author was a Frenchman; he was born
in the land where three dinners can
be made of one potato, and where
moonshine is a substantial part of
every thing. He performed his voyage,
standing on a waxed floor, and making
a circuit of his shelves; the titles
of his books had been his facts, and
the titillations of his snuff the food of
his fancy. But John Bull is of another
style of thinking. His appetite
requires solid realities, and I give him
docks, wharfs, steam-engines, and
manufactures, for his powerful mastication.&mdash;But,
what scents are these,
rising with such potentiality upon the
morning breeze? What sounds, "by
distance made more sweet?" What
a multitude of black, brown, bustling
beings are crushing up that narrow
avenue, from these open boats, like
a new invasion of the pirate squadrons
from the north of old. Oh, Billingsgate!&mdash;I
scent thee&mdash;</p>

<p>The effect was not equally rapturous
in the Thames; but on we flew,
passing groups of buildings which
would have overtopped all the castles
on the Rhine, had they but been on
fair ground; depots of wealth, which
would have purchased half the provinces
beyond the girdle of the Black
Forest; and huge steamers, which
would have towed a captive Armada
to the Tower.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tower</span>! what memories are
called up by the name! How frowning
are those black battlements, how
strong those rugged walls, how massive
those iron-spiked gates! Every
stone is historical, and every era of
its existence has been marked by the
mightiest changes of men, monarchs,
and times; then I see the fortress,
the palace and the prison of kings!</p>

<p>But, let me people those resounding
arches, dim passages, and solemn
subterraneans, with the past. Here,
two thousand years ago, Julius Cæsar
kept his military court, with Quæstors,
Prefects, and Tribunes, for his secretaries
of state; Centurions for his
chamberlains; and Augurs for his
bishops. On this bank of the stately
river, on which no hovel had encroached,
but which covered with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
unpolluted stream half the landscape,
and rolled in quiet majesty to
meet the ocean; often stood the man,
who was destined to teach the Republican
rabble of Rome that they had a
master. I leave antiquarians to settle
the spot trodden by his iron sandal.
I disdain the minute meddling of the
men of <i>fibulæ</i> and <i>frustums</i> of pitchers.
But I can see&mdash;"in my mind's eye,
Horatio"&mdash;the stately Roman casting
many an eager glance eastward, and
asking himself, with an involuntary
grasp of his hilt, and an unconscious
curl of his lip, how long he was to
suffer the haranguers of the populace,
the pilferers of the public, the hirelings
of Cinna and Sylla, and of every
man who would hire them, the whole
miry mass of reformers, leaguers, and
cheap-bread men, to clap their wings
like a flight of crows over the bleeding
majesty of Rome.</p>

<p>Then the chance sound of a trumpet,
or the tread of a cohort along the
distant rampart, would make him turn
back his glance, and think of the
twenty thousand first-rate soldiers
whom a wave of his finger would
move across the Channel, send
through Gaul, sacking Lutetia, darting
through the defiles of the Alps, and
bringing him in triumph through the
Janiculum, up to the temple of the
Capitoline Jove. Glorious dreams, and
gloriously realised! How vexatious
is it that we cannot see the past, that
we cannot fly back from the bustle of
this blacksmith world, from the jargon
of public life, and the tameness
of private toil; into those majestic
ages, when the world was as magnificent
as a theatre; when nations
were swallowed up in the shifting of
a scene; when all were fifth acts, and
when every catastrophe broke down
an empire!</p>

<p>But, what sounds are these? The
steamer had shot along during my
reverie, and was now passing a long
line of low-built strong vessels, moored
in the centre of the river. I looked
round, and here was more than a
dream of the past; here was the past
itself&mdash;here was man in his primitive
state, as he had issued from the forest,
before a profane axe had cropped its
brushwood. Here I saw perhaps five
hundred of my fellow-beings, no more
indebted to the frippery of civilisation
than the court of Caractacus.&mdash;Bold
figures, daring brows, Herculean
shapes, naked to the waist, and with
skins of the deepest bronze. Cast in
metal, and fixed in a gallery, they
would have made an incomparable
rank and file of gladiatorial statues.</p>

<p>The captain of the steamer explained
the phenomenon. They were
individuals, who, for want of a clear
perception of the line to be drawn between
<i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, had been sent
on this half-marine half-terrestrial
service, to reinforce their morals.
They were now serving their country,
by digging sand and deepening the
channel of the river. The scene of
their patriotism was called the "hulks,"
and the patriots themselves were
technically designated felons.</p>

<p>Before I could give another glance,
we had shot along; and, to my surprise,
I heard a chorus of their voices in the
distance. I again applied to my Cicerone,
who told me that all other
efforts having failed to rectify their
moral faculties; a missionary singing-master
had been sent down among
them, and was reported to be making
great progress in their conversion.</p>

<p>I listened to the sounds, as they followed
on the breeze. I am not romantic;
but I shall say no more.
The novelty of this style of reformation
struck me. I regarded it as one
of the evidences of national advance.&mdash;My
thoughts instinctively flowed
into poetry.</p>

<p class="noind">&mdash;Still moving on, still passing multitudinous
agglomerations of brick,
mortar, stone, and iron, rather than
houses.&mdash;Docks crowded with masts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
thicker than they ever grew in a
pine forest, and echoing with the
sounds of hammers, cranes, forges
and enginery, making anchors for all
the ships of ocean, rails for all the
roads of earth, and chain-cables for a
dozen generations to come. In front
of one of those enormous forges,
which, with its crowd of brawny
hammerers glaring in the illumination
of the furnace, gave me as complete a
representation of the Cyclops and
their cave, as any thing that can be
seen short of the bowels of Ætna;
stood a growing church, growing of
iron; the walls were already half-way
grown up. I saw them already pullulating
into windows, a half-budded
pulpit stood in the centre, and a
Gothic arch was already beginning
to spread like the foliage of a huge
tree over the aisle. It was intended
for one of the colonies, ten thousand
miles off.</p>

<p>As the steamer is not suffered in
this part of the river to run down
boats at the rate of more than five
miles an hour; I had leisure to see the
operation. While I gazed, the roof had
<i>leaved</i>; and my parting glance showed
me the whole on the point of flourishing
among the handsomest specimens
of civic architecture.</p>

<p>In front of another forge stood a
lighthouse; it was consigned to the
West Indies. Three of its stone predecessors
had been engulfed by
earthquakes, a fourth had been swept
off by a hurricane. This was of iron,
and was to defy all the chances of
time and the elements, by contract,
for the next thousand years. It was
an elegant structure, built on the
plan of the "Tower of the Winds."
Every square inch of its fabric, from
the threshold to the vane, was iron!
"What will mankind come to," said
George Canning, "in fifty years
hence? The present age is impudent
enough, but I foresee that the next
will be all <i>Irony</i> and <i>Raillery</i>."</p>

<p>But all here is a scene of miracle.
In our perverseness we laugh at our
"Lady of Loretto," and pretend to
doubt her house being carried from
Jerusalem on the backs of angels.
But what right have I to doubt, where
so many millions are ready to take
their oaths to the fact? What is it
to us how many angels might be
required for the operation? or how
much their backs may have been
galled in the carriage? The result is
every thing. But here we have before
our sceptical eyes the very same result.
We have St Catherine's hospital, fifty
times the size, transported half-a-dozen
miles, and deposited in the
Regent's Park. The Virgin came
alone. The hospital came, with all
its fellows, their matrons, and their
master. The virgin-house left only a
solitary excavation in a hillside. The
hospital left a mighty dock, filled
with a fleet that would have astonished
Tyre and Sidon, buildings
worthy of Babylon, and a population
that would have sacked Persepolis.</p>

<p>But, what is this strangely shaped
vessel, which lies anchored stem and
stern in the centre of the stream, and
bearing a flag covered over with characters
which as we pass look like hieroglyphics?
The barge which marks
the Tunnel. We are now moving
above the World's Wonder! A thousand
men, women, and children, have
marched under that barge's keel since
morning; lamps are burning fifty feet
under water, human beings are breathing,
where nothing but the bones of a
mammoth ever lay before, and check-takers
are rattling pence, where the
sound of coin was never heard since
the days of the original Chaos.</p>

<p>What a field for theory! What
a subject for a fashionable Lecturer!
What a topic for the gossipry of itinerant
science, telling us (on its own
infallible authority) how the globe
has been patched up for us, the degenerated
and late-born sons of Adam!
How glowingly might their fancy lucubrate
on the history of the prior
and primitive races which may now
be perforating the interior strata of
the globe&mdash;working by their own gas-light,
manufacturing their own metals,
and, from their want of the Davy-lamp,
(and of an Act of Parliament,
to make it burn,) producing those
explosions which <i>we</i> call earthquakes,
while our volcanoes are merely the
tops of their chimneys!</p>

<p>But this scene is memorable for
more ancient recollections. It was in
this spot, that once, every master of
a merchant ship took off his hat in
reverence to the <i>genius loci</i>; but never
dared to drop his anchor. It was
named the Pool, from the multitude
of wrecks which had occurred there
in the most mysterious manner; until
it was ascertained that it was the
chief resort of the mermen and mermaids,
who originally haunted the
depths of the sylvan Thamesis.</p>

<p>There annually, from ages long before
the Olympiads, the youths and
maidens came, to fling garlands into
the stream, and inquire the time proper
for matrimony. It was from one
of their chants, that John Milton
borrowed his pretty hymn to the presiding
nymph&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Listen, where thou art sitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In twisted braids of lilies knitting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loose trains of thy amber-dropping hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Listen, for dear honour's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Goddess of the Silver Lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Listen and save!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span></p>
<p>On the coast of Norway there is
another Pool, entitled the Maelstrom,
where ships used to disappear, no
one knew why. But the manner was
different; they no sooner touched the
edge of the prohibited spot than they
were swept with the fury of a hurricane
into the centre, where they no
sooner arrived than they were pulled
down, shattered into a thousand fragments,
and never heard of more.
This was evidently the work of the
mermen, who however, being of Northern
breed, had, like the usual generation
of that wild and winterly region,
tempers of indigenous ferocity. But
the tenants of the Thames, inheriting
the softer temper of their clime, were
gentler in their style of administering
justice, which they administered effectually,
notwithstanding. Every unlucky
vessel which stopped upon the
exclusive spot, quietly sank. The
operation regularly took place in the
night. By morning the only remnant
of its existence was discoverable
among the huts along the shore, exhibiting
foreign silks, Dutch drams,
French brandy, and other forbidden
articles, which, somehow or other, had
escaped from the bosom of the deep.</p>

<p>The legend goes on to say, that
from those fatalities the place was
cautiously avoided, until, about a
hundred and fifty years ago, one fine
evening in May, a large merchantman
came in full sail up the river, and
dropped her anchor exactly in the
spot of peril. All the people of the
shore were astounded at this act of
presumption, and numberless boats
put off to acquaint the skipper with his
danger. But, as the legend tells, "he
was a bold vain man, with a huge
swaggering sword at his side, a purse
in his girdle, and a pipe in his mouth.
Upon hearing of the aforesaid tale,
he scoffed greatly, saying, in most
wicked and daring language, that he
had came from the East Indian possessions
of the Dutch republic, where
he had seen jugglers and necromancers
of all kinds; but he defied them all,
and cared not the lighting of his meerscham
for all the mermaids under the
salt seas." Upon the hearing of
which desperate speech all the bystanders
took to their boats, fearing
that the good ship would be plucked
to the bottom of the river without
delay.</p>

<p>But at morning dawn the good ship
still was there, to the surprise of
all. However, the captain was to have
a warning. As he was looking over
the stern, and laughing at the story,
the steersman saw him suddenly turn
pale and fix his eyes upon the water,
then running by at the rate of about
five knots. The crew hurried forward,
and lo and behold! there arose close to
the ship a merman, a very respectable-looking
person, in Sunday clothes and
with his hair powdered, who desired
the captain to carry his vessel from
the place, because "his anchor had
dropt exactly against his hall door,
and prevented his family from going
to church."</p>

<p>The whole history is well known
at Deptford, Rotherhithe, and places
adjacent; and it finishes, by saying,
that the captain, scoffing at the request,
the merman took his leave with
an angry expression on his countenance,
a storm came on in the night,
and nothing of captain, crew, or ship,
as ever heard of more.</p>

<p>But the spot is boundless in legendary
lore. A prediction which had
for centuries puzzled all the readers
of Mother Shipton, was delivered by
her in the small dwelling whose ruins
are still visible on the Wapping shore.
The prophecy was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eighteene hundred thirty-five,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of us shall be alive?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a king shall ende his reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a knave his ende shall gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a statesman be in trouble;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a scheme the worlde shall bubble;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a man shall selle his vote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a man shall turne his coat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Righte be wronge, and wronge be righte,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Westminster's candle-lighte.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But, when from the top of Bow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the dragon stoop full low.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from church of holy Paul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall come down both crosse and ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all men shall see them meete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the land, yet by the Fleet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When below the Thamis bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be seen the furnace red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When its bottom shall drop out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making hundreds swim about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a fishe had never swum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall doleful tidings come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flood and famine, woe and taxe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melting England's strength like waxe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she fights both France and Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall all be well again!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I shall have an infinite respect for
Mother Shipton in future. All was
amply verified. The repairs of St
Paul's, in the year stated, required that
the cross and ball should be taken
down, which was done accordingly.
Bow Church, whose bells are supposed
to thrill the <i>intima præcordia</i> of every
Londoner's memory in every part of
the globe, happening to be in the
same condition, the dragon on the
spire was also taken down, and cross,
ball, and dragon, were sent to a
coppersmith's, in Ludgate Hill, beside
the Fleet prison, where they were to
be seen by all the wondering population,
lying together. The third feature
of the wisdom of Mother Shipton
was fulfilled with equal exactitude.
The Thames Tunnel had been pushed
to the middle of the river's bed, when,
coming to a loose portion of the clay,
the roof fell in; the Thames burst
through its own bottom, the Tunnel
was instantly filled, and the workmen
were forced to swim for their lives.
The remainder of the oracle, partly
present, is undeniable while we have
an income tax, and the <i>finale</i> may be
equally relied on, to the honour of the
English Pythonness.</p>

<h2>RECENT ROYAL MARRIAGES.</h2>


<p>At this dull season, the long
vacation of legislators, when French
deputies and English members, weary
of bills and debates, motions and
amendments, take their autumnal
ramble, or range their well-stocked
preserves, and when newspapers are
at their wits' end for subjects of discussion,
a topic like the Spanish marriages,
intrinsically so important, in
arrival so opportune, has naturally
monopolised the attention of the daily
press. For some time previously, the
English public had paid little attention
to Spanish affairs. Men were weary
of watching the constant changes,
the shameless corruption, the scandalous
intrigues, from which that
unfortunate country and its unquiet
population have so long suffered;
they had ceased in great measure
to follow the thread of Peninsular
politics. The arbitrary and unconstitutional
influences employed at the
last elections, and the tyranny exercised
towards the press, deprived
foreigners of the most important data
whence to judge the real state of
public feeling and opinion south of
the Pyrenees. The debates of Cortes
elected under circumstances of flagrant
intimidation, and whose members,
almost to a man, were creatures of a
<i>Camarilla</i>, were no guide to the sentiments
of a nation: journalists, sorely
persecuted, writing in terror of bayonets,
in peril of ruinous fine and
arbitrary imprisonment, dared not
speak the voice of truth, and feared
to echo the wishes and indignation of
the vast but soldier-ridden majority
of their countrymen. Thus, without
free papers or fair debates to guide
them, foreigners could attain but an
imperfect perception of the state of
Spanish affairs. The view obtained
was vague&mdash;the outline faint and
broken&mdash;details were wanting. Hence
the Spanish marriages, although so
much has been written about them,
have in England been but partially
understood. Much indignation and
censure have been expended upon
those who achieved them; many conjectures
have been hazarded as to
their proximate and remote consequences;
but one very curious point
has barely been glanced at. Scarcely
an attempt has been made to investigate
the singular state of parties, and
strange concurrence of circumstances,
that have enabled a few score persons
to overbalance the will of a nation.
How is it that a people, once so great
and powerful, still so easy to rouse,
and jealous of its independence, has
suffered itself to be fooled by an
abandoned Italian woman, and a wily
and unscrupulous foreign potentate&mdash;by
a corrupt <i>Camarilla</i>, and a party
that is but a name? How is it that
Spain has thus unresistingly beheld
the consummation of an alliance so
odious to her children, and against
which, from Portugal to the Mediterranean,
from Gibraltar's straits to
Cantabria's coast, but one opinion is
held, but one voice heard&mdash;a voice of
reprobation and aggrieved nationality?</p>

<p>Yes, within the last few weeks,
wondering Europe has witnessed a
strange spectacle. A queen and her
sister, children in years and understanding,
have been wedded&mdash;the
former completely against her inclinations,
the latter in direct opposition
to the wishes and interests of her
country, and in defiance of stern
remonstrance and angry protest from
allied and powerful states&mdash;to most
unsuitable bridegrooms. The queen,
Isabella of Spain, has, it is true, a
Spaniard for her husband; and him,
therefore, her jealous and suspicious
subjects tolerate, though they cannot
approve. Feeble and undecided of
character, unstable in his political
opinions&mdash;if, indeed, political opinions
he have other than are supplied to
him, ready formed, by insidious and
unworthy advisers&mdash;Don Francisco
de Assis is the last man to sit on
the right hand of a youthful queen,
governing an unsettled country and a
restless people, to inspire her with
energy and assist her with wise counsels.
It redounds little to the honour
of the name of Bourbon, that if it
was essential the Queen should marry
a member of that house, her present
husband was, with perhaps one exception,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
as eligible a candidate as could
be selected. That marriage decided
upon, however, it became doubly
important to secure for the Infanta
Luisa&mdash;the future Queen of Spain
should her sister die without issue&mdash;a
husband in all respects desirable; and,
above all, one agreeable to the Spanish
nation. Has this been done? What
advantages does the husband of the
girl of fourteen, of the heir-presumptive
to the Spanish crown, bring to
Spain, in exchange for the rich dowery
of his child-bride&mdash;for the chance, not
to say the probability, of being a
queen's husband&mdash;and for an immense
accession of influence to his dynasty
in the country where that dynasty
most covets it? The advantages are
all of a negative kind. By that marriage,
Spain, delivered over to French
intrigues, exposed to the machinations
and vampire-like endearments of an
ancient and hereditary foe, becomes
<i>de facto</i> a vassal to her puissant
neighbour.</p>

<p>The question of the Queen of Spain's
marriage was first mooted within a
very few days after her birth. In
the spring of 1830, Queen Christina
found herself with child for the first
time; and her husband, Ferdinand
VII., amongst whose many bad and
unkingly qualities want of foresight
could not be reckoned, published the
Pragmatic Sanction that secured the
crown to his offspring should it prove
a girl. A girl it was; and scarcely
had the infant been baptised, when
her father began to think of a husband
for her. "She shall be married," he
said, "to a son of my brother Francisco."
By and by Christina bore
a second daughter, and then the King
said&mdash;"They shall be married to the
two eldest sons of my brother Francisco."</p>

<p>Ferdinand died; and, as he had
often predicted&mdash;comparing himself
to the cork of a bottle of beer, which
restrains the fermented liquor&mdash;at his
death civil war broke out. Isabella
was still an infant; the first thing to
be done was to secure her the crown;
and for the time, naturally enough,
few thought about her marriage.
Queen Christina was an exception.
She apparently remembered and respected
her husband's wishes; and in
her conversations and correspondence
with her sister, Luisa Carlota, wife of
the Infante Don Francisco de Paulo,
she frequently referred to them, and
expressed a strong desire for their
fulfilment. In the month of June of
the present year, a Madrid newspaper,
the <i>Clamor Publico</i>, published
a letter of hers, written most strongly
in that sense. It bears date the 23d
of January 1836, and is the reply to
one from Doña Luisa Carlota, in
which reference was made to conversations
between the two sisters and
Ferdinand, respecting the marriage of
his daughters to the sons of Don
Francisco. "The idea has always
flattered my heart," Christina wrote,
"and I would fain see its realisation
near at hand; for it was the wish and
will of the beloved Ferdinand, which
I will ever strive to fulfil in all that
depends on me. * * * Besides
which, I believe that the national representation,
far from opposing, will
approve these marriages, as advantageous
not only to our family, but to
the nation itself, your sons being
Spanish princes. I will not fail to
propose it when the moment arrives."
Notwithstanding these fair promises,
and her respect for the wishes of
Ferdinand the well-beloved, we find
Christina, less than two years later,
negotiating for her royal daughter a
very different alliance. Irritated, on
the one hand, against the Liberal
party, to whose demands she had
been compelled to yield; and alarmed,
upon the other, at the progress of the
Carlist armies, which were marching
upon Madrid, then defended only by
the national guards, she treated with
Don Carlos for a marriage between
the Queen and his eldest son. The
Carlists were driven back to their
mountain strongholds, and, the pressing
danger over&mdash;although the war
still continued with great fury&mdash;that
project of alliance was shelved, and
another, a very important one, broached.
It was proposed to marry the
Queen of Spain to an archduke of
Austria, who should command the
Spanish army, and to whom Christina
expressed herself willing to give a
share of the Regency, or even to yield
it entirely. This was the motive of
the mission of Zea Bermudez to Vienna.
That envoy stipulated, as an
indispensable condition of the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
of his negotiations, that they should
be kept a profound secret from the
King of the French. The condition
was not observed. Christina herself,
it is said, unable to keep any thing
from her dear uncle, told him all, and
Bermudez had to leave Vienna almost
before the matter in hand had been
entered upon. Thereupon the queen-mother
reverted to the marriage with
a son of Don Carlos. The Conde de
Toreno, for a moment weak enough
to enter into her views, endeavoured
to prepare the public for their disclosure,
by announcing in the Cortes,
that wars like the one then devastating
Spain could only be terminated by
a compromise&mdash;meaning a marriage.
The Cortes thought differently, and,
by other means, the war was brought
to a close.</p>

<p>The year 1840 witnessed the expulsion
of Christina from Spain, and the
appointment of Espartero to the Regency.
During his three years' sway,
that general refused to make or meddle
in any way with the Queen's marriage.
He said, that as she was not
to marry till her majority, and as
he should then no longer be Regent,
his government had no occasion to
busy itself with the matter. The
friends of Spain have reason to wish
that the Duke de la Victoria had
shown himself less unassuming and
reserved with respect to that most
important question. Whilst it was
thus temporarily lost sight of at
Madrid, the queen-mother, in her retirement
at Paris, took counsel with
the most wily and far-sighted sovereign
of Europe, and from that time
must doubtless be dated the plans
which Christina and Louis Philippe
have at last so victoriously carried
out. They had each their own interests
in view&mdash;their own objects to
accomplish&mdash;and it so chanced that
those interests and objects were easily
made to coincide. Concerning those
of Christina, we shall presently speak
at some length; those of the French
king are now so notorious, that it is
unnecessary to do more than glance
at them. His first plan&mdash;a bold one,
certainly&mdash;was to marry the Queen of
Spain to the Duke d'Aumale. To
this, Christina did not object. Her
affection for her daughter&mdash;since then
grievously diminished&mdash;prompted her
to approve the match. The duke was
a fine young man, and very rich. To
a tender mother&mdash;which she claimed
to be&mdash;the temptation was great.
Doubtless, also, she received from
Louis Philippe, as price of her concurrence,
an assurance that certain
private views and arrangements of
her own should not to be interfered
with&mdash;certain guardianship accounts
and unworthy peculations not too
curiously investigated. Of this, more
hereafter. The result of the intrigues
and negotiations between the Tuileries
and the Hotel de Courcelles, was
the diplomatic mission of M. Pageot,
who was sent to London and to the
principal continental courts, to announce,
on the part of the King of
the French, that, considering himself
the chief of the Bourbon family, he
felt called upon to declare that, according
to the spirit of the treaty of
Utrecht, the Queen of Spain could
marry none but a Bourbon prince.
The success of this first move, intended
as a feeler to see how far he
could venture to put forward a son of
his own, was not such as to flatter the
wishes of the French monarch. The
reply of the British government was,
that, according to the constitution of
Spain, the Cortes must decide who
was to be the Queen's husband and
that he whom the Cortes should select,
would, for England, be the legitimate
aspirant. Without being so
liberal in tone, the answers given by
the cabinets of Vienna and Berlin
were not more satisfactory; and the
spleen of the French king manifested
itself by the mouth of M. Guizot, who,
with less than his usual prudence,
went so far as to menace Spain with
a war, if the Queen married any but
a Bourbon. This occurred in March
1843.</p>

<p>In the following June, Espartero,
in his turn, was driven from power
and from his country. Well known
as it was, that French man&oelig;uvres and
French gold had, by deluding the
nation, and corrupting the army,
powerfully contributed to the overthrow
of the only conscientious and
constitutional ruler with whom Spain
had for a long period been blessed, it
was expected that Christina and her
friends would do their utmost to bring
about the immediate marriage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
Queen and the Duke d'Aumale. Then
occurred the long projected and much
talked of visit of Queen Victoria to the
castle of Eu, where the question of Isabella's
marriage was made the subject
of a conference between the sovereigns
of France and England, assisted
by their ministers for foreign affairs,
M. Guizot and Lord Aberdeen. It was
shortly afterwards known that the
King of the French had given the
most satisfactory pledges, which were
communicated to the principal foreign
courts, that he not only would not
strive to effect a marriage between the
Queen of Spain and a son of his, but
that he would positively refuse his
consent to any such union. Further
that if a marriage should be arranged
between the Duke of Montpensier and
the Infanta Luisa, it should not take
place till Isabella was married and
had issue. As an equivalent to these
concessions, the English minister for
foreign affairs had to declare, that
without entering into an examination
of the Treaty of Utrecht, or recognising
any right contrary to the complete
independence of the Spanish
nation, it was desirable that the
Queen should wed a descendant of
Philip the Fifth, provided always such
marriage was brought about conformably
with the rules prescribed by
the constitution of Spain.</p>

<p>Compelled to abandon the design
of marrying Isabella to a French
prince, Louis Philippe, like a wary
and prudent general, applied himself
to improve the next best position, to
which he had fallen back, and where
he determined to maintain himself.
Aumale could not have the Queen,
but Montpensier should have the
Infanta; and the aim must now be to
increase the value of prize No. 2, by
throwing prize No. 1 into the least
worthy hands possible. In other
words, the Queen must be married to
the most incapable and uninfluential
blockhead, who, being of Bourbon
blood, could possibly be foisted upon
her and the Spanish nation. To this
end Count Trapani was pitched upon;
and the first Narvaez ministry&mdash;including
Señor Pedal and other birds
of the same disreputable feather&mdash;which
succeeded the one presided
over by that indecent charlatan
Gonzales Bravo, did all in its power
to forward the pretensions of the
Neapolitan prince, and accomplish his
marriage with the Queen. To this
end it was absolutely necessary to
dispense with the approbation of the
Cortes, required by the constitution.
For although those Cortes had been
chosen without the concurrence of the
Progresista party&mdash;whose chiefs were
all in exile, in prison, or prevented by
the grossest intimidation from voting
at the elections&mdash;on the question of
the Trapani marriage they were found
indocile. This profound contempt
and marked antipathy with which
Spaniards view whatever comes from
Naples, and the offence given to the
national dignity by the evident fact,
that this candidate was imposed upon
the country by the French government,
convinced the latter, and that
of Spain, which was its instrument,
that even the Cortes they themselves
had picked and chosen, lacked baseness
or courage to consent to the
Trapani alliance. Then was resolved
upon and effected the constitutional
<span class="smcap">Reform</span>, suppressing the article that
required the approbation of the
Cortes, and replacing it by another,
which only rendered it compulsory to
<i>announce</i> to them the husband chosen
by the Queen. But the man&oelig;uvres
of France were too clumsy and palpable.
It was known that Christina
had promised the hand of the Infanta
to the Duke of Montpensier; Louis
Philippe's object in backing Trapani
was easily seen through; and so
furious was the excitement of the
public mind throughout Spain, so
alarming the indications of popular
exasperation, that the unlucky Neapolitan
candidate was finally thrown
overboard.</p>

<p>Here we must retrace our steps, and
consider Queen Christina's motives in
sacrificing what remained to her of
prestige and popularity in her adopted
country, to assist, through thick and
thin, by deceit, subterfuge, and
treachery, the ambitious and encroaching
views of her French uncle.
There was a time&mdash;it is now long
past&mdash;when no name was more loved
and respected by the whole Spanish
nation, excluding of course the Carlist
party, than that of Maria Christina
de Borbon. She so frankly
identified herself with the country in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
which marriage fixed her lot, that in
becoming a Spanish queen she had
apparently become a Spanish woman;
and, in spite of her Neapolitan birth,
she speedily conquered the good-will
of her subjects. Thousands of political
exiles, restored to home and
family by amnesties of her promotion,
invoked blessings on her head: the
great majority of the nation, anxious
to see Spain governed mildly and constitutionally,
not despotically and
tyrannically, hailed in her the good
genius who was to accord them their
desires. Her real character was not
yet seen through; with true Bourbon
dissimulation she knew how to veil
her vices. She had the credit also of
being a tender and unselfish parent,
ever ready to sacrifice herself to the
interests of her children. Her egotism
was as yet unsuspected, her avarice
dormant, her sensuality unrevealed;
and none then dreamed that a day
would come, when, impelled by the
meanest and most selfish motives, she
would urge her weeping daughter into
the arms of a detested and incompetent
bridegroom.</p>

<p>By her <i>liaison</i> with Muñoz, the first
blow was given to Christina's character
and popularity. This scandalous
amour with the son of a cigar-seller at
Tarançon, a coarse and ignorant man,
whose sole recommendations were
physical, and who, when first noticed
by the queen, occupied the humble
post of a private garde-de-corps, commenced,
in the belief of many, previously
to the death of Ferdinand.
Be that true or not, it is certain that
towards the close of the king's life,
when he was helpless and worn out
by disease, the result of his reckless
debaucheries, she sought the society
of the stalwart lifeguardsman, and
distinguished him by marks of favour.
It was said to be through her interest
that he was promoted to the rank of
cadet in the body-guard, which gave
him that of captain in the army.
Ferdinand died, and her intrigue was
speedily manifest, to the disgust and
grief of her subjects. In time of peace
her degrading devotion to a low-born
paramour would doubtless have called
forth strong marks of popular indignation;
but the anxieties and horrors
of a sanguinary civil war engrossed
the public attention, and secured her
a partial impunity. As it was, her
misconduct was sufficiently detrimental
to her daughter's cause. The
Carlists taunted their opponents with
serving under the banner of a wanton;
and the Liberals, on their part,
could not but feel that their infant
queen was in no good school or safe
keeping.</p>

<p>The private fortune of Ferdinand
the Seventh was well known to be
prodigious. Its sources were not
difficult to trace. An absolute monarch,
without a civil list, when he
wished for money he had but to draw
upon the public revenue for any funds
the treasury might contain. Of this
power he made no sparing use. Then
there was the immense income derived
from the Patrimonia Real, or
Royal Patrimony, vast possessions
which descend from one King of Spain
to another, for their use and benefit
so long as they occupy the throne.
The whole of the town of Aranjuez,
the estates attached to the Pardo,
La Granja, the Escurial, and other
palaces, form only a portion of this
magnificent property, yielding an
enormous annual sum. Add to these
sources of wealth, property obtained
by inheritance, his gains in a nefariously
conducted lottery, and other
underhand and illicit profits, and it
is easy to comprehend that Ferdinand
died the richest capitalist in Europe.
The amount of his savings could but
be guessed at. By some they were
estimated at the incredibly large sum
of eight millions sterling. But no
one could tell exactly, owing to the
manner in which the money was invested.
It was dispersed in the hands
of various European bankers; also in
those of certain American ones, by
whose failure great loss was sustained.
No trifling sum was represented
by diamonds and jewels. It
was hardly to be supposed that the
prudent owner of all this wealth
would die intestate, and there is
scarcely a doubt that he left a will.
To the universal astonishment, however,
upon his decease, none was
forthcoming, and his wole property
was declared at sixty millions of
francs, which, according to the Spanish
law, was divided between his
daughters. No one was at a loss to
conjecture what became of the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
residue there unquestionably was. It
was well understood, and her subsequent
conduct confirmed the belief,
that the lion's share of the royal
spoils was appropriated by the young
widow, whose grief for the loss of the
beloved Ferdinand was not so violent
and engrossing as to make her
lose sight of the main chance. After
so glorious a haul, it might have been
expected that she would hold her
hand, and rest contented with the
pleasing consciousness, that should she
ever be induced or compelled to leave
Spain, she had wherewithal to live
in queenly splendour and luxury. But
her thirst of wealth is not of those
that can be assuaged even by rivers
of gold. Though the bed of the
Manzanares were of the yellow metal,
and she had the monopoly of its sands,
the mine would be all insufficient
to satiate her avarice. After appropriating
her children's inheritance, she
applied herself to increase her store
by a systematic pillage of the Queen
of Spain's revenues. As Isabella's
guardian, the income derived from the
Patrimonio Real passed through her
hands, to which the gold adhered like
steel-dust to a loadstone. Whilst the
nation strained each nerve, and submitted
to the severest sacrifices, to
meet the expenses of a costly war&mdash;whilst
the army was barefoot and
hungered, but still stanch in defence
of the throne of Isabella&mdash;Christina,
with her mouth full of patriotism and
love of Spain, remitted to foreign capitalists
the rich fruits of her peculations,
provision for the rainy day
which came sooner than she anticipated,
future fortunes for Muñoz's
children. The natural effect of her
disreputable intrigue or second marriage,
whichever it at that time was
to be called, was to weaken her affection
for her royal daughters, especially
when she found a second and
numerous family springing up around
her. To her anxiety for this second
family, and to the influence of Muñoz,
may be traced her adherence to the
King of the French, and the cruel and
unmotherly part she has recently
acted towards the Queen of Spain.</p>

<p>Previously to Christina's expulsion
from the Regency in the year 1840,
little was seen or known of her children
by Muñoz. During her three
years' residence at Paris, a similar
silence and mystery was observed
respecting them, and they lived retired
in a country-house near Vevay,
upon the Lake of Geneva, whither
those born in the French capital were
also dispatched. This prudent reserve
is now at an end, and the grandchildren
of the Tarançon tobacconist
sit around, almost on a level with,
the throne of the Spanish Queen.
Titles are showered upon them, cringing
courtiers wait upon their nod, and
the once proud and powerful grandees
of Spain, descendants of the haughty
warriors who drove the Saracens from
Iberian soil, and stood covered in the
presence of the Fifth Charles, adulate
the illegitimate progeny of a Muñoz
and a Christina. Subtile have been
the calculations, countless the intrigues,
shameful the misdeeds that
have led to this result, so much
desired by parents of the ennobled
bastards, so undesirable for the honour
and dignity of Spain. It is
obvious that, with the immense
wealth, whose acquisition has been
already explained, Christina would
have had no difficulty in portioning off
her half-score children, and enabling
them to live rich and independent in
a foreign county. But this arrangement
did not suit her views; still
less did it accord with those of the
Duke of Rianzares. He founded his
objections upon a patriotic pretext.
He wished his children, he said, to be
Spanish citizens, not aliens&mdash;to hold
property in their own country&mdash;to
live respected in Spain, and not as
exiles in a foreign land. It may be
supposed there was no obstacle to
their so doing, and that in Spain, as
elsewhere, they could reckon at least
upon that amount of ease and consideration
which money can give. But
here came the sticking-point, the
grand difficulty, only to be got over
by grand means and great ingenuity.
Christina had been the guardian of
the Queen and Infanta during their
long minority: guardians, upon the
expiration of their trust, are expected
to render accounts; and this the mother
of Isabel was wholly unprepared
to do, in such a manner as would
enable her to retain the plunder accumulated
during the period of her
guardianship. She had certainly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
option of declining to render any&mdash;of
taking herself and her wealth, her
husband and her children, out of
Spain, and of living luxuriously elsewhere.
But it has already been seen,
that neither she nor Muñoz liked the
prospect of such banishment, however
magnificent and numerous the appliances
brought by wealth to render it
endurable. What, then, was to be
done? It was quite positive that the
husbands of the Queen and Infanta
would demand accounts of their wives'
fortune and of its management during
their minority. How were their
demands to be met&mdash;how such difficulties
got over? It was hard to say.
The position resembled what the Yankees
call a "fix." The cruel choice
lay between a compulsary disgorgement
of an amount of ill-gotten gold,
such as no moral emetic could ever
have induced Christina to render up,
and the abandonment of Muñoz's
darling project of making himself and
his children lords of the soil in their
native land. The only chance of an
exit from this circle of difficulties, was
to be obtained by uniting the Queen
and her sister to men so weak and
imbecile, or so under the dominion
and influence of Christina, that they
would let bygones be bygones, take
what they could get and be grateful,
without troubling themselves about
accounts, or claiming arrears. To
find two such men, who should also
possess the various qualifications essential
to the husbands of a Queen
and Infanta of Spain, certainly appeared
no easy matter&mdash;to say nothing
of the odious selfishness and sin
of thus sacrificing two defenceless and
inexperienced children. But Christina's
scruples were few; and, as to
difficulties, her resolution rose as they
increased. Had she not also a wise
and willing counsellor in the most
cunning man in Europe? Was not
her dear uncle and gossip at hand to
quiet her qualms of conscience, if by
such she was tormented, and to demonstrate
the feasibility&mdash;nay, more,
the propriety of her schemes? To
him she resorted in her hour of need,
and with him she soon came to an
understanding. He met her half-way,
with a bland smile and words of promise.
"Marry one of your daughters,"
was his sage and disinterested
advice, "to a son of mine, and be
sure that my boys are too well bred
to pry into your little economics. We
should prefer the Queen; but, if it
cannot be managed, we will take the
Infanta. Isabella shall be given to
some good quiet fellow, not over clever,
who will respect you far too much to
dream of asking for accounts. Of
time we have plenty; be stanch to
me, and all shall go well." What
wonder if from the day this happy
understanding, this real <i>entente cordiale</i>,
was come to, Christina was the
docile agent, the obedient tool, of her
venerable confederate! No general
in the jaws of a defile, with foes in
front and rear, was ever more thankful
to the guide who led him by
stealthy paths from his pressing peril,
than was the daughter of Naples to
her wary adviser and potent ally.
And how charming was the union of
interest&mdash;how touching the unanimity
of feeling&mdash;how beautifully did
the one's ambition and the other's
avarice dovetail and coincide! The
King's gain was the Queen's profit:
it was the slaughter with one pebble
of two much-coveted birds, fat and
savoury mouthfuls for the royal and
politic fowlers.</p>

<p>In the secret conclave at the Tuileries,
"all now went merry as a marriage
bell." In the ears of niece and
uncle resounded, by anticipation, the
joyous chimes that should usher in
the Montpensier marriage, proclaim
their triumph, drown the cries of
rage of the Spanish nation, and the
indignant murmurs of Europe;&mdash;not
that the goal was so near, the prize
so certain and easy of attainment.
Much yet remained to do; a false step
might be ruinous&mdash;over-precipitation
ensure defeat. The King of the French
was not the man to make the one, or
be guilty of the other. With "slow
and sure" for his motto, he patiently
waited his opportunity. In due season,
and greatly aided by French
machinations, the downfall of the impracticable
and incorruptible Espartero
was effected. But the government
of Spain was still in the hands
of the Progresistas. For it will be
remembered that the immediate cause
of Espartero's fall was the opposition
of a section of his own party, which,
united now in their adversity, unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
tunately knew not, in the days of their
power, how to abstain from internal
dissensions. The Lopez ministry held
the reins of government. It was essential
to oust it. As a first step, a
<i>Camarilla</i> was organised, composed of
the brutal and violent Narvaez, the
daring and disreputable Marchioness
of Santa Cruz, and a few others of the
same stamp, all ultra-Moderados in
politics, and fervent partisans of
Christina. So successfully did they
use their backstairs influence, and
wield their weapons of corruption and
intrigue, that, within four months,
and immediately after the accelerated
declaration of the Queen's majority,
Lopez and his colleagues resigned.
Olozaga succeeded them; but he, too,
was a Progresista and an upholder of
Spanish nationality; there was no
hope of his giving in to the plans of
Christina the Afrancesada. Moreover,
he was hated by the <i>Camarilla</i>,
and especially detested by the Queen-mother,
whose expulsion from Paris
he had demanded when ambassador
there from Espartero's government.
She determined on a signal vengeance.
The Palace Farce, that strange episode
in the history of modern Spanish
courts, must be fresh in every one's
memory. An accusation, as malignant
as absurd, was trumped up against
Olozaga, of having used force, unmanly
and disloyal violence, to compel
Isabella to sign a decree for the dissolution
of the Cortes. No one really
believed the ridiculous tale, or that
Salustiano de Olozaga, the high-bred
gentleman, the uniformly respectful
subject, could have afforded by his
conduct the shadow of a ground for
the base charge. Subsequently, in
the Cortes, he nobly faced his foes,
and, with nervous and irresistible eloquence,
hurled back the calumny in
their teeth. But it had already served
their turn. To beat a dog any stick
will do; and the only care of the
<i>Camarilla</i> was to select the one that
would inflict the most poignant wound.
Olozaga was hunted from the ministry,
and sought, in flight, safety from the
assassin's dagger. Those best informed
entertained no doubt that his
expulsion was intimately connected
with the marriage question. With
him the last of the Progresistas were
got rid of, and all obstacles being removed,
the Queen-mother returned to
Madrid.</p>

<p>Were the last crowning proof insufficient
to carry conviction, it would
be easy to adduce innumerable minor
ones of Christina's heartless selfishness&mdash;of
her disregard to the happiness,
and even to the commonest
comforts, of her royal daughter. We
read in history of a child of France,
the widow of an English king, who,
when a refugee in the capital of her
ancestors, lacked fuel in a French
palace, and was fain to seek in bed
the warmth of which the parsimony
of a griping Italian minister denied
her the fitting means. It is less
generally known, that only six years
ago, the inheritress of the throne of
Ferdinand and Isabella was despoiled
of the commonest necessaries of life
by her own mother, a countrywoman
of the miserly cardinal at whose
hands Henrietta of England experienced
such shameful neglect. When
Christina quitted Spain in 1840, she
not only carried off an enormous
amount of national property, including
the crown jewels, but also her daughter's
own ornaments; and, at the same
time, even the wardrobe of the poor
child was mysteriously, but not unaccountably,
abstracted: Isabella was
left literally short of linen. As to
jewels, it was necessary immediately
to buy her a set of diamonds, in order
that she might make a proper appearance
at her own court. Such was
the considerate and self-denying conduct
of the affectionate mother, who,
in the winter of 1843, resumed her
place in the palace and counsels of
the Queen of Spain. In her natural
protector, the youthful sovereign found
her worst enemy.</p>

<p>Persons only superficially acquainted
with Spanish politics commonly fall
into two errors. They are apt to
believe, first, that the two great parties
which, with the exception of the
minor factions of Carlists and Republicans,
divide Spain between them,
are nearly equally balanced and national;
secondly, that Moderados and
Progresistas in Spain are equivalent
to Conservatives and Radicals in
other countries. Blunders both. Eccentric
in its politics, as in most
respects, Spain cannot be measured
with the line and compass employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
to estimate its neighbours. It is
impossible to conceal the fact, that
to-day the numerous and the national
party in Spain is that of the Progresistas.
The tyranny of Narvaez, the
misconduct of Christina, and, above
all, the French marriage, have greatly
strengthened their ranks and increased
their popularity. Their principles are
not subversive, nor their demands
exorbitant: they aim at no monopoly
of power. Three things they earnestly
desire and vehemently claim: the
freedom of election guaranteed by
the existing constitution of Spain, but
which has been so infamously trampled
upon by recent Spanish rulers,
liberty of the press, and the preservation
of Spain from foreign influence
and domination.</p>

<p>Let us examine the composition
and conduct of the party called Moderado.
This party, now dominant, is
unquestionably the most split up and
divided of any that flourish upon
Spanish soil. It is not deficient in
men of capacity, but upon none of
the grave questions that agitate the
country can these agree. When the
Cortes sit, this is manifest in their
debates. Although purged of Progresistas,
the legislative chambers
exhibit perpetual disagreement and
wrangling. At other times, the dissensions
of the Moderados are made
evident by their organs of the press.
In some of these appear articles
which would not sound discordant in
the mouths of Progresistas; in others
are found doctrines and arguments
worthy of the apostles of absolutism.
Between Narvaez and Pacheco the
interval is wider than between Pacheco
and the Progresistas. The first, in
order to govern, sought support from
the Absolutists; the second could not
rule without calling the Liberals to his
aid. Subdivided into fractions, this
party, whose nomenclature is now
complicated, relies for existence less
upon itself than upon extraneous circumstances,
foreign support, and the
equilibrium of the elements opposed
to it. The anarchy to which it is a
prey, has been especially manifest
upon the marriage question. Whilst
one of its organs shamelessly supported
Trapani, others cried out for a
Coburg; and, again, others insisted
that a Spanish prince was the only
proper candidate&mdash;thus coinciding
with the Progresistas. In fact, the
Moderados, afraid, perhaps, of compromising
their precarious existence
had no candidate of their own; and
in their fluctuations between foreign
influence and interior exigencies, between
court and people, between
their wish to remain in power and
the difficulty of retaining it, they left,
in great measure, to chance, the election
in which they dared not openly
meddle. This will sound strange to
the many who, as we have already
observed, imagine the Moderado party
to be the Conservative one of England
or France; but not to those
aware of the fact, that it is a collection
of unities, brought together rather
by accidental circumstances than by
homogeneity of principles, united for
the exclusion of others, and for their
own interests, not by conformity of
doctrines and a sincere wish for their
country's good.</p>

<p>Such was the party, unstable and
unpatriotic, during whose ascendancy
Christina and her royal confederate
resolved to carry out their dishonest
projects. The Queen-mother well
knew that the mass of the nation
would be opposed to their realisation;
but she reckoned on means sufficiently
powerful to render indignation impotent,
and frustrate revolt. She trusted
to the adherence of an army, purposely
caressed, pampered, and corrupted;
she felt strong in the support of a
monarch, whose interest in the affair
was at least equal to her own; she
observed with satisfaction the indifferent
attitude assumed by the British
government with respect to Spanish
affairs. A Progresista demonstration
in Galicia, although shared in by seven
battalions of the army&mdash;an ugly symptom&mdash;was
promptly suppressed, owing
to want of organisation, and to the
treachery or incapacity of its leader.
The scaffold and the galleys, prison
and exile, disposed of a large proportion
of the discontented and dangerous.
Arbitrary dismissals, of which,
for the most part, little was heard out
of Spain, purified the army from the
more honest and independent of its
officers, suspected of disaffection to
the existing government, or deemed
capable of exerting themselves to
oppose an injurious or discreditable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
alliance. Time wore on; the decisive
moment approached. Each day it
became more evident that the Queen's
marriage could not with propriety
be much longer deferred. Setting
aside other considerations, she had
already fully attained the precocious
womanhood of her country; and it
was neither safe nor fitting that she
should continue to inhale the corrupt
atmosphere of the Madrid court without
the protection of a husband. At
last the hour came; the plot was ripe,
and nothing remained but to secure
the concurrence of the victim. One
short night, a night of tears and repugnance
on the one hand, of flatteries,
of menaces and intimidation, on
the other decided the fate of Isabella.
With her sister less trouble was requisite.
It needed no great persuasive
art to induce a child of fourteen
to accept a husband, as willingly as
she would have done a doll. It might
have been thought necessary to consult
the will of the Spanish nation,
fairly represented in freely elected
Cortes. Such, at least, was the course
pointed out by the constitution of the
country. It would also have been
but decorous to seek the approval and
concurrence of foreign and friendly
states, to establish beyond dispute,
that the proposed marriages were in
contravention of no existing treaties;
for, with respect to one of them, this
doubt might fairly be raised. But
all such considerations were waived;
decency and courtesy alike forgotten.
The double marriage was effected in
the manner of a surprise; and, if creditable
to the skill, it most assuredly
was dishonourable to the character of
its contriver. Availing himself of the
moment when the legislative chambers
of England, France, and Spain,
had suspended their sittings; although,
as regards those of the latter country,
this mattered little, composed, as they
are, of venal hirelings&mdash;the French
King achieved his grand stroke of
policy, the project on which, there
can be little doubt, his eyes had for
years been fixed. His load of promises
and pledges, whether contracted
at Eu or elsewhere, encumbered him
little. They were a fragile commodity,
a brittle merchandise, more for
show than use, easily hurled down
and broken. Striding over their
shivered fragments, the Napoleon of
Peace bore his last unmarried son to
the goal long marked out by the paternal
ambition. The consequences
of the successful race troubled him
little. What cared he for offending
a powerful ally and personal friend?
The arch-schemer made light of the
fury of Spain, of the discontent of
England, of the opinion of Europe.
He paused not to reflect how far his
Machiavelian policy would degrade him
in the eyes of the many with whom
he had previously passed for wise and
good, as well as shrewd and far-sighted.
Paramount to these considerations was
the gratification of his dynastic ambition.
For that he broke his plighted
word, and sacrificed the good understanding
between the governments of
two great countries. The monarch of
the barricades, the <i>Roi Populaire</i>, the
chosen sovereign of the men of July,
at last plainly showed, what some
had already suspected, that the aggrandisement
of his family, not the
welfare of France, was the object he
chiefly coveted. Conviction may later
come to him, perhaps it has already
come, that <i>le jeu ne valoit pas la chandelle</i>,
the game was not worth the wax-lights
consumed in playing it, and
that his present bloodless victory
must sooner or later have sanguinary
results. That this may not be the
case, we ardently desire; that it will
be, we cannot doubt. The peace of
Europe may not be disturbed&mdash;pity
that it should in such a quarrel; but
for poor Spain we foresee in the Montpensier
alliance a gloomy perspective
of foreign domination and still recurring
revolution.</p>

<p>A word or two respecting the King-consort
of Spain, Don Francisco de
Assis. We have already intimated
that, as a Spanish Bourbon, he may
pass muster. 'Tis saying very little.
A more pitiful race than these same
Bourbons of Spain, surely the sun
never shone upon. In vain does one
seek amongst them a name worthy of
respect. What a list to cull from!
The feeble and imbecile Charles the
Fourth; Ferdinand, the cruel and treacherous,
the tyrannical and profligate;
Carlos, the bigot and the hypocrite;
Francisco, the incapable. Nor is the
rising generation an improvement upon
the declining one. How should it be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
with only the Neapolitan cross to improve
the breed? Certainly Don
Francisco de Assis is no favourable
specimen, either physically or morally,
of the young Bourbon blood. For the
sake of the country whose queen is
his wife, we would gladly think well
of him, gladly recognise in him qualities
worthy the descendant of a line
of kings. It is impossible to do so.
The evidence is too strong the other
way. If it be true, and we have reason
to believe it is, that he came forward
with reluctance as a candidate
for Isabella's hand, chiefly through
unwillingness to stand in the light of
his brother Don Enrique, partly perhaps
through consciousness of his
own unfitness for the elevated station
of king-consort, this at least shows
some good feeling and good sense.
Unfortunately, it is the only indication
he has given of the latter quality.
His objections to a marriage with his
royal cousin were overruled in a manner
that says little for his strength of
character. When it was found that
his dislike to interfere with his brother's
pretensions was the chief stumbling-block,
those interested in getting over
it set the priests at him. To their influence
his weak and bigoted mind
was peculiarly accessible. Their task
was to persuade him that Don Enrique
was no better than an atheist,
and that his marriage with the Queen
would be ruinous to the cause of religion
in Spain. This was a mere
fabrication. Enrique had never shown
any particularly pious dispositions,
but there was no ground for accusing
him of irreligion, no reason to believe
that, as the Queen's husband, he would
be found negligent of the church's
forms, or setting a bad example to the
Spanish nation. The case, however,
was made out to the satisfaction of
the feeble Francisco, whose credulity
and irresolution are only to be equalled
in absurdity by the piping treble of
the voice with which, as a colonel of
cavalry, he endeavoured to convey
orders to his squadrons. Sacrificing,
as he thought, fraternal affection to
the good of his country, he accepted
the hand reluctantly placed in his,
became a king by title, but remained,
what he ever must be, in reality a
zero.</p>

<p>It was during the intrigues put in
practice to force the Trapani alliance
upon Spain, that the Spanish people
turned their eyes to Don Francisco
de Paulo's second son, who lived
away from the court, following with
much zeal his profession of a sailor.
Not only the Progresistas, but that
section of the Moderados whose principles
were most assimilated to theirs,
looked upon Don Enrique as the candidate
to be preferred before all
others. For this there were many
reasons. As a Spaniard he was naturally
more pleasing to them than a
foreigner; in energy and decision of
character he was far superior to his
brother. Little or nothing was known
of his political tendencies; but he had
been brought up in a ship and not in
a palace, had lived apart from <i>Camarillas</i>
and their evil influences,
and might be expected to govern the
country constitutionally, by majorities
in the Cortes, and not by the aid and
according to the wishes of a pet party.
The general belief was, that his marriage
with Isabella would give increased
popularity to the throne,
destroy illegitimate influences, and
rid the Queen of those interested and
pernicious counsellors who so largely
abused her inexperience. These
very reasons, which induced the
great mass of the nation to view Don
Enrique with favour, drew upon him
the hatred of Christina and her
friends. He was banished from
Spain, and became the object of
vexatious persecutions. This increased
his popularity; and at one time, if his
name had been taken as a rallying
cry, a flame might have been lighted
up in the Peninsula which years
would not have extinguished. The
opportunity was inviting; but, to their
honour be it said, those who would
have benefited by embracing it, resisted
the temptation. It is no secret
that the means and appliances of a
successful insurrection were not wanting;
that money wherewith to buy
the army was liberally forthcoming;
that assistance of all kinds was offered
them; and that their influence in Spain
was great; for in the eyes of the nation
they had expiated their errors,
errors of judgment only, by a long
and painful exile. But, nevertheless,
they would not avail themselves of
the favourable moment. So long as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span>
hope remained of obtaining their just
desires by peaceable means, by the
force of reason and the <i>puissante propagande
de la parole</i>, they refused
again to ensanguine their native soil,
and to re-enter Spain on the smoking
ruins of its towns, over the lifeless
bodies of their mistaken countrymen.</p>

<p>By public prints of weight and information,
it has been estimated, that
during Don Enrique's brief stay at
Paris, he indignantly rejected certain
friendly overtures made to him by the
King of the French. The nature of
these overtures can, of course, only
be conjectured. Perhaps, indeed,
they were but a stratagem, employed
by the wily monarch to detain his
young cousin at Paris, that the apparent
good understanding between
them might damp the courage of the
national party in Spain, and win the
wavering to look with favour upon the
French marriage. There can be little
question that in the eyes of Louis
Philippe, as well as of Christina, Don
Francisco is a far more eligible husband
for the Queen than his brother would
have been, even had the latter given
his adhesion to the project of the
Montpensier alliance. Rumour&mdash;often,
it is true, a lying jade&mdash;maintained
that at Paris he firmly refused
to do so. She now whispers that at
Brussels he has been found more
pliant, and that, within a brief delay,
the happy family at Madrid will be
gratified by the return of that truant
and mutinous mariner, Don Enrique
de Borbon, who, after he has been
duly scolded and kissed, will doubtless
be made Lord High Admiral, or
rewarded in some equally appropriate
way for his tardy docility. We vouch
not for the truth of this report; but
shall be noway surprised if events
speedily prove it well founded. Men
there are with whom the love of
country is so intense, that they would
rather live despised in their own land
than respected in a foreign one. And
when, to such flimsy Will-o'-the-wisp
considerations as the esteem and love
of a nation, are opposed rank, money,
and decorations, a palace to live in,
sumptuous fare, and a well-filled
purse, and perhaps, ere long, a wealthy
bride, who would hesitate? If any
would, seek them not amongst the
Bourbons. Loath indeed should we
be to pledge ourselves for the consistency
and patriotism of a man whose
uncle and grandfather betrayed their
country to a foreign usurper. The
fruit of a corrupt and rotten stem
must ever be looked upon with suspicion.
It is the more prized when
perchance it proves sound and wholesome.</p>

<p>Of the Duke of Montpensier, previously
to his marriage, little was heard,
and still, little is generally known of
him, except that his exterior is agreeable,
and that he had been rapidly
pushed through the various military
grades to that of general of artillery.
That any natural talents he may be
endowed with, have been improved
to the utmost by careful education,
is sufficiently guaranteed by the fact
of his being a son of Louis Philippe.
We are able to supply a few further
details. The Infanta's husband is a
youth of good capacity, possessing a
liberal share of that mixture of sense,
judgment, and wit, defined in his
native tongue by the one expressive
word <i>esprit</i>. His manners are pleasant
and affable; he is a man with whom
his inferiors in rank can converse,
argue, even dispute&mdash;not a stilted
Spanish Bourbon, puffed up with
imaginary merit, inflated with
etiquette, and looking down, from the
height of his splendid insignificance
and inane pride, upon better men
then himself. He is one, in short,
who rapidly makes friends and partisans.
Doubtless, during his late
brief visit to Spain, he secured some;
hereafter he will have opportunities
of increasing their number; and the
probabilities are, that in course of
time he will acquire a dangerous influence
in the Peninsula. The lukewarm
and the vacillating, even of the
Progresista party, will be not unlikely,
if he shows or affects liberalism
in his political opinions, to take
him into favour, and give him the
weight of their adherence; forgetting
that by so doing they cherish an anti-national
influence, and twine more securely
the toils of France round the
recumbent Spanish lion. On the
other hand, there will always be a
powerful Spanish party, comprising a
vast majority of the nation, and by
far the largest share of its energy and
talent, distinguished by its inveterate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span>
dislike of French interlopers, repulsing
the duke and his advances by every
means in their power, and branding
his favourers with the odious name of
<span class="smcap">Afrancesados</span>. To go into this subject,
and enlarge upon the probable
and possible results of the marriage,
would lead us too far. Our object in
the present article has rather been to
supply <small>FACTS</small> than indulge in speculations.
For the present, therefore,
we shall merely remind our readers,
that jealousy of foreign interference is
a distinguishing political characteristic
of Spaniards; and that, independently
of this, the flame of hatred to France
and Frenchmen still burns brightly in
many a Spanish bosom. Spain has
not yet forgiven, far less forgotten,
the countless injuries inflicted on her
by her northern neighbours: she still
bears in mind the insolent aggressions
of Napoleon&mdash;the barbarous cruelties
of his French and Polish legions&mdash;the
officious interference in '23. These
and other wrongs still rankle in her
memory. And if the effacing finger
of Time had begun to obliterate their
traces, the last bitter insult of the
forced marriage has renewed these in
all their pristine freshness.</p>

<p>We remember to have encountered,
in a neglected foreign gallery, an ancient
picture of a criminal in the hands
of torturers. The subject was a painful
one, and yet the painting provoked
a smile. Some wandering brother of
the brush, some mischievous and idly-industrious
<span class="smcap">Tinto</span>, had beguiled his
leisure by transmogrifying the costumes
both of victim and executioners,
converting the ancient Spanish garb
into the stiff and unpicturesque apparel
of the present day. The vault
in which the cruel scene was enacted,
remains in all its gloomy severity of
massive pillars, rusty shackles, and
cobwebbed walls; the grim unshapely
instruments of torture were there;
the uncouth visages of the executioners,
the agonised countenance of the
sufferer, were unaltered. But, contrasting
with the antique aspect and
time-darkened tints of these details,
were the vivid colouring and modern
fashions of Parisian <i>paletots</i>, trim pantaloons,
and ball-room waistcoats. We
have been irresistibly reminded of this
defaced picture by the recent events
in Spain. They appear to us like a
page from the history of the middle
ages transported into our own times.
The daring and unprincipled intrigue
whose <i>dénoûment</i> has just been witnessed,
is surely out of place in the
nineteenth century, and belongs more
properly to the days of the Medicis
and the Guise. A review of its circumstances
affords the elements of
some romantic history of three hundred
years ago. At night, in a palace, we
see a dissolute Italian dowager and a
crafty French ambassador coercing a
sovereign of sixteen into a detested
alliance. The day breaks on the
child's tearful consent; the ambassador,
the paleness of his vigil chased
from his cheek by the flush of triumph,
emerges from the royal dwelling.
Quick! to horse!&mdash;and a courier starts
to tell the diplomat's master that the
glorious victory is won. A few days&mdash;a
very few&mdash;of astonishment to
Europe and consternation to Spain,
and a French prince, with gay and
gallant retinue, stands on the Bidassoa's
bank and gazes wistfully south-wards.
Why does he tarry; whence
this delay? He waits an escort.
Strange rumours are abroad of ambuscade
and assassination; of vows
made by fierce guerillas that the Infanta's
destined husband shall never see
Madrid. At last the escort comes.
Enclosed in serried lines of bayonets
and lances, dragoons in van, artillery
in rear, the happy bridegroom prosecutes
his journey. What is his welcome?
Do the bright-eyed Basque
maidens scatter flowers in his path
and Biscay's brave sons strain their
stout arms to ring peals in his honour?
Do the poor and hardy
peasantry of Castile line the highway
and shout <i>vivas</i> as he passes?
Not so. If bells are rung and flowers
strewn, it is by salaried ringers and by
women hired, not to wail at a funeral,
but to celebrate a marriage scarcely
more auspicious. If hurrahs, few
and faint, are heard, those who utter
are paid for them. Sullen looks and
lowering glances greet the Frenchman,
as, guarded by two thousand men-at-arms,
he hurries to the capital where
his bride awaits him. In all haste,
amidst the murmurs of a deeply
offended people, the knot is tied.
Not a moment must be lost, lest
something should yet occur to mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
the marriage feast. And now for
the rewards, shamefully showered
upon the venal abettors of this unpopular
union. A dukedom and
grandeeship of Spain for the ambassador's
infant son; titles to mercenary
ministers; high and time-honoured
decorations, once reserved as the premium
for exalted valour and chivalrous
deeds&mdash;to corrupt deputies; diamond
snuff-boxes, jewels and gold, to the
infamous writers of prostituted journals;
Christina rejoices; her <i>Camarilla</i>
are in ecstasies; Bresson rubs
his hands in irrepressible exultation;
in his distant capital the French monarch
heaves a sigh of relief and satisfaction
as his telegraph informs him
of the <i>fait accompli</i>. Then come
splendid bullfights and monster <i>pucheros</i>,
to dazzle the eyes and stop
the mouths of the multitude. <i>Pan y
toros&mdash;panisac circenses</i>&mdash;to the many-headed
beast. And in all haste the
prince hurries back to Paris with his
bride, to receive the paternal benediction,
the fraternal embrace, and the
congratulations of the few score individuals,
who alone, in all France, feel
real pleasure and profit in his marriage.
And thus, by foreign intrigue
and domestic treachery, has the independence
of Spain been virtually
bought and sold.</p>

<h2>THE GAME LAWS.</h2>


<p>From our youth upwards we have
entertained a deep feeling of affection
for the respectable fraternity
of the Quakers. Our love, probably,
had its date and origin from very
early contemplation of a print, which
represented an elderly pot-bellied individual,
with a broad-brimmed hat and
drab terminations, in the act of concluding
a treaty with several squatting
Indians, only redeemed from a
state of nature by a slight garniture
of scalps and wampum. Underneath
was engraved a legend which our
grand-aunt besought us to treasure in
our memory as a sublime moral lesson.
It ran thus:&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Bloodless
Triumph, or Penn's Treaty with
the Chiefs</span>; and we were told that
the fact thereby commemorated was
one of the most honourable achievements
to be found in the pages of
general history. With infantine facility
we believed in the words of the
matron. No blood or rapine&mdash;no
human carcasses or smoking wigwams,
deformed the march of the
Quaker conqueror. Beneath a mighty
tree, in the great Indian wilderness,
was the patriarchal council held; and
the fee-simple of a territory, a good
deal larger than an average kingdom,
surrendered, with all its pendicles of
lake, prairie, and hunting-ground, to
the knowing philanthropist, in exchange
for some bales of broad-cloth,
a little cutlery, a liberal allowance of
beads, and a very great quantity, indeed,
of adulterated rum and tobacco.
Never, we believe, since Esau sold his
birth-right, was a tract of country
acquired upon terms so cheap and
easy. Some faint idea of this kind
appears to have struck us at the
time; for, in answer to some question
touching the nature of the goods supposed
to be contained in several bales
and casks which were prominently represented
in the picture, our relative
hastily remarked, that she did not
care for the nature of the bargain&mdash;the
principle was the great consideration.
And so it is. William Penn
unquestionably acted both wisely and
well: he brought his merchandise to
a first-rate market, and left a valuable
legacy of acuteness to his children and
faithful followers. Our grand-aunt&mdash;rest
her soul!&mdash;died in the full belief
of ultimate Pennsylvanian solvency.
She could not persuade herself, that
the representatives of the man who
had acquired a principality at the expense
of a ship-load of rubbish, would
prove in any way untrue to their bonds;
and by her last will and testament,
whereof we are the sole executor, she
promoted us to the agreeable rank of
a creditor on the Pennsylvanian government.
If any gentleman is desirous
to be placed in a similar position,
with a right to the new stock
which has been recently issued in
lieu of a monetary dividend, he may
hear of an excellent investment by an
early application to our brokers. We
also are most firm believers in the
fact of American credit, and we shall
not change our opinion&mdash;at least until
we effect the sale.</p>

<p>All this, however, is a deviation
from our primary purpose, which was
to laud and magnify the Brotherhood.
We repeat that we loved them early,
and also that we loved them long. It
is true that some years ago a slight
estrangement&mdash;the shadow of a summer
cloud&mdash;disturbed the harmony
which had previously existed between
Maga and the Society of Friends. A
gentleman of that persuasion had
been lost somewhere upon the skirts
of Helvellyn, and our guide and
father, Christopher, in one of those
sublime prose-p&oelig;ans which have entranced
and electrified the world,
commemorated that apotheosis so
touchingly, that the whole of Christendom
was in tears. Unfortunately,
some passing allusion to the garments
of the defunct Obadiah, grated uncomfortably
on the jealous ear of
Darlington. An affecting picture of
some ravens, digging their way
through the folds of the double-milled
kerseymere, was supposed to
convey an occult imputation upon
the cloth, and never, since then, have
we stood quite clear in the eyes of
the offended Conventicle. Still, that
unhappy misunderstanding has by no
means cooled our attachment. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
honour and revere the Friends; and it
was with sincere pleasure that we
saw the excellent Joseph Pease take
his seat and lift up his voice within
the walls of Parliament. Had Pease
stood alone, we should not now, in all
human probability, have been writing
on the subject of the game laws.</p>

<p>We are, however, much afraid
that a great change has taken place
in the temper and disposition of the
Society. Formerly a Quaker was
considered most essentially a man
of peace. He was reputed to abhor
all strife and vain disputation&mdash;to be
laconic and sparing in his speech&mdash;and
to be absolutely crapulous with
humanity. We would as soon have
believed in the wrath of doves as in
the existence of a cruel Quaker; nor
would we, during the earlier portion
of our life, have entrusted one of that
denomination with the drowning of a
superfluous kitten. Barring a little
absurd punctilio in the matter of payment
of their taxes&mdash;at all times, we
allow, a remarkably unpleasant ceremony&mdash;the
public conduct of our
Friends was blameless. They seldom
made their voices heard except in the
honourable cause of the suffering or
the oppressed; and with external politics
they meddled not at all, seeing
that their fundamental ideas of a social
system differed radically from those
entertained by the founders of the
British constitution. Such, and so
harmless, were the lives of our venerated
Friends, until the demon of discord
tempted them by a vision of the
baleful hustings.</p>

<p>Since then we have remarked, with
pain, a striking alteration in their
manner. They are bold, turbulent,
and disputatious to an almost incredible
extent. If there is any row
going on in the parish, you are sure
to find that a Quaker is at the bottom
of it. Is there to be a reform in
the Police board&mdash;some broad-brimmed
apostle takes the chair. Are
tithes obnoxious to a Chamber of
Commerce&mdash;the spokesman of the
agitators is Obadiah. Indeed, we are
beginning to feel as shy of a quarrel
with men of drab as we formerly were
with the militant individuals in scarlet.
We are not quite so confident as
we used to be in their reliance upon
moral force, and sometimes fear the
latent power which lurks in the physical
arm.</p>

<p>Of these champions, by far the
most remarkable is Mr John Bright,
who, in the British House of Commons,
represents the town of Durham.
The tenets of his peaceful
and affirmative creed, are, to say the
least of it, in total antagonism to his
character. Ever since he made his
first appearance in public, he has kept
himself, and every one around him,
in perpetual hot-water. In the capacity
of Mr Cobden's bottle-holder, he
has displayed considerable pluck, for
which we honour him; and he is not
altogether unworthy to have been
included in that famous eulogy which
was passed by the late Premier&mdash;no
doubt to the cordial satisfaction of his
friends&mdash;upon the Apostle of cotton
and free-trade. The name of John is
nearly as conspicuous as that of Richard
in the loyal annals of the League; and
we are pleased to observe, that, like
his great generalissimo, Mr Bright
has preferred his claim for popular
payment, and has, in fact, managed
to secure a few thousands in return
for the vast quantity of eloquence
which he has poured into the pages
of Hansard. We are not of that old-fashioned
school who object to the
remuneration of our reformers. On
the contrary, we think that patriotism,
like every other trade, should
be paid for; and with such notable
examples, as O'Connell in Ireland,
and the Gamaliel of Sir Robert in the
south, we doubt not that the principle
hereafter will be acted upon in
every case. The man who shall
be fortunate enough to lead a successful
crusade against the established
churches, and to sweep away
from these kingdoms all vestiges both
of the mitre and the Geneva gown,
will doubtless, after sufficient laudation
by the then premier, of the talent
and perseverance which he has exhibited
throughout the contest, receive
from his liberated country something
of an adequate douceur. What precise
pension is due to him who shall
deliver us from the thraldom of the
hereditary peerage, is a question which
must be left to future political arithmetic.
In the mean time, there are
several minor abuses which may be
swept away on more moderate scavenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span>
wages; and one of these which
we fully expect to hear discussed in
the ensuing session of Parliament, is
the existence of the Game laws.</p>

<p>Mr Bright, warned by former experience,
has selected a grievance for
himself, and started early in his expedition
against it. The part of jackal
may be played once, but it is not a
profitable one; and we can understand
the disappointed feelings of the
smaller animal, when he is forced to
stand by an-hungered, and behold
the gluttonous lion gorging himself
with the choicest morsels of the chase.
It must be a sore thing for a patriot
to see his brother agitator pouching
his tens and hundreds of thousands;
whilst he, who likewise has
shouted in the cause, and bestowed
as much of his sweet breath as would
have served to supply a furnace, must
perforce be contented with some stray
pittances, doled hesitatingly out, and
not altogether given without grudging.
No independent and thoroughgoing
citizen will consent, for a second time,
to play so very subsidiary a part;
therefore he is right in breaking fresh
ground, and becoming the leader of a
new movement. It may be that his
old monopolising ally shall become
too plethoric for a second contest.
Like the desperate soldier who took
a castle and was rewarded for it, he
may be inclined to rest beneath his
laurels, count his pay, and leave the
future capture of fortalices to others
who have less to lose. A hundred
thousand pounds carry along with
them a sensation of ease as well as
dignity. After such a surfeit of Mammon,
most men are unwilling to work.
They unbutton their waistcoats, eschew
agitation, eat, drink, are merry,
and become fat.</p>

<p>Your lean Cassius, on the contrary,
has all the pugnacity of a terrier. He
yelps at every body and every thing,
is at perpetual warfare with the whole
of animated nature, and will not be
quieted even by dint of much kicking.
The only chance you have of relieving
yourself from his everlasting yammering
and impertinence, is to throw him
an unpicked bone, wherewith he will
retreat in double-quick time to the
kennel. And of a truth the number
of excellent bones which are sacrificed
to the terriers of this world, is absolutely
amazing. Society in general
will do a great deal for peace; and
much money is doled out, far less for
the sake of charity, than as the price
of a stipulated repose.</p>

<p>It remains, however, to be seen
whether Mr Bright, under any circumstances,
will be quiet. We almost
doubt it. In the course of his stentorial
and senatorial career, he has
more than once, to borrow a phrase
from <i>Boxiana</i>, had his head put into
chancery; and some of his opponents,
Mr Ferrand for example, have fists
that smite like sledge-hammers. But
Friend John is a glutton in punishment;
and though with blackened
eyes and battered lips, is nevertheless
at his post in time. The best pugilists
in England do not know what
to make of him. He never will admit
that he is beaten, nor does he seem
to know when he has enough. It is
true that at every round he goes
down before some tremendous facer
or cross-buttock, or haply performs
the part of Antæus in consequence of
the Cornish hug. No matter&mdash;up he
starts, and though rather unsteady
on his pins, and generally groggy in
his demeanour, he squares away at
his antagonist, until night terminates
the battle, and the drab flag, still
flaunting defiance, is visible beneath
the glimpses of the maiden moon.</p>

<p>At present, Mr Bright's senatorial
exertions appear to be directed towards
the abolition of the Game laws.
Early in 1845, and before the remarkable
era of conversion which must
ever render that year a notorious one
in the history of political consistency,
he moved for and obtained a select
committee of the House to inquire
into the operation of these laws. Mr
Bright's speech upon that occasion
was, in some respects, a sensible
one. We have no wish to withhold
from him his proper meed of praise;
and we shall add, that the subject
which he thus virtually undertook to
expiscate, was one in every way
deserving of the attention of the
legislature. Of all the rights of property
which are recognised by the
English law, that of the proprietor or
occupier of the land to the <i>feræ naturæ</i>
or game upon it, is the least generally
understood, and the worst defined.
It is fenced by, and founded upon, statutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
which, in the course of time,
have undergone considerable modification
and revision; and the penalties
attached to the infringement of it are,
in our candid opinion, unnecessarily
harsh and severe. Further, there can
be no doubt, that in England the vice
of poaching, next to that of habitual
drinking, has contributed most largely
to fill the country prisons. Instances
are constantly occurring of ferocious
assault, and even murder, arising
from the affrays between gamekeepers
and poachers; nor does it appear that
the statutory penalties have had the
effect of deterring many of the lower
orders from their violent and predatory
practices. On these points, we
think an inquiry, with a view to the
settlement of the law on a humane
and equitable footing, was highly
proper and commendable; nor should
we have said a single word in depreciation
of the labours of Mr Bright,
had he confined himself within proper
limits. Such, however, is not the
case.</p>

<p>An abridgement of, or rather extracts
from, the voluminous evidence
which was taken before that select
committee, has been published by a
certain Richard Griffiths Welford,
Esq., barrister at law, and member
of the Royal Agricultural Society
of England. With this gentleman
hitherto, it is our misfortune or our
fault that we have had no practical
acquaintance; and judging from the
tone, humour, and temper of the text
remarks which are scattered throughout
the volume, and the taste of the
foot-notes appended, we do not see
any reason to covet exuberant intimacy
for the future. The volume is
prefaced by a letter from Mr John
Bright to the Tenant Farmers of
Great Britain, which is of so remarkable
a nature that it justly challenges
some comment. The following extract
is the commencement of that address:&mdash;
"I am invited by my friend Mr
Welford, the compiler of the abstract
of the evidence given before the committee
on the Game laws, to write a
short address to you on the important
question which is treated of in this
volume. I feel that an apology is
scarcely necessary for the liberty I
am taking; the deep interest I have
long felt in the subject of the Game
laws, my strong conviction of its
great importance to you as a class,
and the extensive correspondence in
reference to it which I have maintained
with many of your respected
body in almost every county of England
and Scotland, seem to entitle
me to say a few words to you on this
occasion.</p>

<p>"From the perusal of this evidence&mdash;and
it is but a small portion
of that which was offered to the committee&mdash;you
will perceive that, as
capitalists and employers of labour,
<i>you are neither asserting your just
rights, nor occupying your proper position</i>.
By long-continued custom,
which has now obtained almost the
force of law, when you became tenants
of a farm, you were not permitted to
enjoy the advantages which pertain
to it so fully as is the case with the
occupiers of almost every other description
of property. A farmer
becomes the tenant of certain lands,
which are to be the basis of his future
operations, and the foundation of that
degree of prosperity to which he may
attain. To secure success, it is needful
that capital should be invested,
and industry and skill exercised; and
in proportion as these are largely
employed, in order to develop to the
utmost extent the resources of the
soil, will be the amount of prosperity
that will be secured. The capital,
skill, and industry, will depend upon
the capacity of the farmer; but the
reward for their employment will depend
in no small degree upon the free
and unfettered possession of the land&mdash;of
its capabilities, of all that it produces,
and of all that is sustained
upon its surface. There is a mixture
of feudalism and of commercial principles
in your mode of taking and
occupying land, which is in almost all
cases obstructive, and in not a few
utterly subversive, of improvement.
You take a farm on a yearly tenantry,
or on a lease, with an understanding,
or a specific agreement, that the game
shall be reserved to the owner; that
is, you grant to the landlord the right
to stock the farm&mdash;for which you are
to pay him rent for permission to cultivate,
and for the full possession of
its produce&mdash;with pheasants, partridges,
hares, and rabbits, to any
extent that may suit his caprice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
There may be little game when you
enter upon the farm; but in general
you reserve to yourselves no power
to prevent its increase, and it may
and often does increase so, as to destroy
the possibility of profit in the
cultivation of the farm. You plough,
and sow, and watch the growing crops
with anxiety and hope; you rise early,
and eat the bread of carefulness; rent-day
comes twice a-year with its inexorable
demand; and yet you are
doomed too frequently to see the fertility
which Providence bestows and
your industry would secure, blighted
and destroyed <i>by creatures which would
be deemed vermin</i>, but for the sanction
which the law and your customs give
to their preservation, and which exist
for no advantage to you, and for no
good to the public, but solely to afford
a few day's amusement in the year to
the proprietors of the soil. The seed
you sow is eaten by the pheasants;
your young growing grain is bitten
down by the hares and rabbits; and
your ripening crops are trampled and
injured by a live stock which yields
you no return, and which you cannot
kill and take to market. No other
class of capitalists are subjected to
these disadvantages&mdash;no other intelligent
and independent class of your
countrymen are burdened with such
impositions."</p>

<p>We pity the intelligence of the
reader who does not behold in these
introductory paragraphs the symbol
of the cloven foot. The sole object
of the volume, for which Mr Bright
has the assurance to stand as sponsor,
is to sow the seeds of discord between
the landowners and the tenants of
England, by representing the former
to the latter in the light of selfish
monopolists, who, for the sake of some
little sport or yearly battue, or, it
may be, from absolute caprice, make
havoc throughout the year, by proxy,
of the farmers' property, and increase
their stock of game whenever they
have an opportunity, at his expense,
and sometimes to his actual ruin.
Such is the tendency of this book,
which is compiled for general circulation;
and which, we think, in many
respects is calculated to do a deal of
harm. As a real treatise or commentary
upon the Game laws, it is
worthless; as an attack upon the
landed gentry, it will doubtless be
read in many quarters with extreme
complacency. Already, we observe,
a portion of the press have made it a
text-book for strong political diatribes;
and the influence of it will no doubt
be brought to bear upon the next
general election. As we ourselves
happen to entertain what are called
very liberal opinions upon this subject
of the Game laws, and as we
maintain the principle that in this,
as in every other matter, the great
interests and rights of the community
must be consulted, without reference
to class distinctions&mdash;as we wish to
see the property of the rich and the
liberties of the poor respected&mdash;as we
consider the union and cordial co-operation
between landlord and tenant
the chief guarantee which this country
yet possesses against revolution, and
the triumph of insolent demagogues&mdash;our
remarks upon the present subject
may not be ill-timed, or unworthy of
the regard of those who think with
us, that, in spite of recent events,
there yet may be something to preserve.</p>

<p>But, first, let us consider who this
gentleman is that comes forward, unsolicited,
to tender his advice, and to
preach agitation to the tenantry of
Great Britain. He is one of those
persons who rose with the League&mdash;one
of those unscrupulous and ubiquitous
orators who founded and
reared their reputation upon an avowed
hostility to the agricultural interests
of the country. Upon this point
there can be no mistake. John
Bright, member for Durham, is a
child of the corn, or rather the potato
revolution, as surely as Anacharsis
Clootz was the <i>enfant trouvé</i> of the
Reign of Terror. With the abstract
merits of that question we have nothing
to do at present. It is quite
sufficient for us to note the fact, that
he, in so far as his opportunities and
his talents went, was amongst the
most clamorous of the opponents to
the protection of British agriculture;
and that fact is a fair and legitimate
ground for suspicion of his motives,
when we find him appearing in the
new part of an agricultural champion
and agitator. It is not without considerable
mistrust that we behold this
slippery personage in the garb and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span>
character of Triptolemus. He does
not act it well. The effects of the
billy-roller are still conspicuous upon
his gait&mdash;he walks ill on hobnails&mdash;and
is clearly more conversant with
devil's-dust and remnants than with
tares. Some faint suspicion of this
appears at times to haunt even his
own complacent imagination. He is
not quite sure that the farmers&mdash;or,
in the elegant phraseology of the
League, the hawbucks and chawbacons&mdash;whom
he used to denounce as
a race of beings immeasurably inferior
in intellectual capacity to the
ricketty victims of the factories, will
believe all at once in the cordiality
and disinterestedness of their adviser;
and therefore he throws out for their
edification a specious bit of pleading,
which, no doubt, will be read with conflicting
feelings by some of those who
participated in the late conversion.
"You have been taught to consider
me, and those with whom I have
acted, as your enemies. You will
admit that we have never deceived you&mdash;that
we have never <small>TAMELY SURRENDERED</small>
that which we have taught
you to rely upon as the basis of your
prosperity&mdash;that we have not pledged
ourselves to a policy you approved, and
then abandoned it; and as you have
found me persevering in the promotion
of measures, which many of you
deemed almost fatal to your interests,
but which I thought essential to the
public good, so you will find me as
resolute in the defence of those rights,
which your own or your country's interests
alike require that you should
possess."</p>

<p>All this profession, however, we
hope, will fail to persuade the farmers
that their late enemy has become their
sudden friend; and they will doubtless
look with some suspicion upon
the apocryphal catalogue of grievances
which Mr Bright has raked together,
and, with the aid of his associate,
promulgated in the present volume.
It is not our intention at present to
extract or go over the evidence at
large. We have read it minutely,
and weighed it well. A great part of
it is utterly irrelevant, as bearing
upon questions of property and contract
with which the legislature of no
country could interfere, and which
even Mr Bright, though not over
scrupulous in his ideas of parliamentary
appropriation, has disregarded
in framing the conclusions of the
rejected report which he proposed
for the adoption of the committee.
That portion, however, we shall
not pass over in silence. It is
but right that the country at large
should see that this volume has been
issued, not so much for the purpose of
obtaining a revision of the law, as of
sowing discord amongst the agriculturists
themselves; and it is very remarkable
that Mr Bright, throughout
the whole of his inflammatory address,
<i>takes no notice whatever of the
Game laws</i>, or their prejudicial effect,
or their possible remedy by legislative
enactment, but confines himself to
denunciation of the landlords as a
class antagonistic to the tenantry,
and advice to the latter to combine
against the game-preserving habits of
the gentry.</p>

<p>Now this question between landlord
and tenant has nothing to do
with the Game laws. The man who
purchases an estate, purchases it with
every thing upon it. He has, strictly
speaking, as much right to every wild
animal which is bred or even lodges
there&mdash;if he can only catch or kill
them&mdash;as he has to the trees, or the
turf, or any other natural produce. The
law protects him in this right, in so far,
that by complying with certain statutory
regulations&mdash;one of which relates
to revenue, and requires from him a
qualification to sport, and another
prescribes a period or rotation for
shooting&mdash;he may, within his own
boundaries, take every animal which
he meets with, and may also prevent any
stranger from interfering with or
encroaching upon that privilege. We
do not now speak of penalties for
which the intruder may be liable.
That is a separate question; at present
we confine ourselves to the abstract
question of right.</p>

<p>But neither game nor natural produce
constitute that thing called
<small>RENT</small>, without which, since the days
of forays have gone by, a landowner
cannot live. Accordingly, he proposes
to let a certain portion of his domains
to a farmer, whose business is to cultivate
the soil, and to make it profitable.
He does so; and unless a distinct
reservation is made to the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
the right to take the game upon
the farm so let, passes to the tenant,
and can be exercised by him irrespective
of the wish of the landlord. If,
on the contrary, the landlord refuses
to part with that right which is primarily
vested in his person, and which,
of course, he is at full liberty either
to reserve or surrender, the proposing
tenant must take that circumstance
into consideration in his offer of rent
for the farm. The game then becomes
as much a matter of calculation
as the nature of the soil, the necessity
of drainage, or the peculiar climate of
the farm. The tenant must be guided
by the principles of ordinary prudence,
and make such a deduction
from his offer as he considers will
compensate him for the loss which his
crop may sustain through the agency
of the game. If he neglects to do
this, he has no reasonable ground for
murmuring&mdash;if he does it, he is perfectly
safe. Such is the plain simple
nature of the case, from which one
would think it difficult to extract any
clamant grievance, at least between the
landlord and the tenant. No doubt the
tenantry of the country individually
and generally may, if they please, insist
in all cases on a complete surrender
of the game; and if they do, it is far
more than possible that their desire
will be universally complied with.
But, then, they will have to pay higher
rents. The landlord is no gainer in
respect of game, nay, he is a direct
loser; for the fact of his preservation
and reserval of it reduces the amount
of rent which he otherwise would receive,
and, besides this, he is at much
expense in preserving. Game is his
hobby which he insists upon retaining:
he does so, and he actually pays for
it. Therefore, when a tenant states
that he has lost so much in a particular
year in consequence of the game
upon his farm, that statement must
be understood with a qualification.
His crop may indeed have suffered
to a certain extent; but then he has
been paid for that deterioration already,
the payment being the difference
of rent, fixed between him and
the landlord for the occupation of a
game farm, less than what he would
have offered for it had there been no
game there, or had the right to kill it
been conceded.</p>

<p>"O but," says Mr Bright, or some
other of the <i>soi-disant</i> friends of the
farmer, "there is an immense competition
for land, and the farmers will
not make bargains!" And whose
fault is that? We recollect certain
apothegms rather popular a short
while ago, about buying in the cheapest
and selling in the dearest market,
and so forth, and we have always
understood that the real price of an
article is determined by the demand
for it. If any farm is put up to auction
under certain conditions, there is
no hardship whatever in exacting the
rent from the highest successful competitor.
The reservation of the right
to kill game is as competent to the
proprietor as the fixing the rotation
of the crops, or the conditions against
scourging the soil. The landlord,
when he lets a farm, does not by any
means, as Mr Bright and his legal
coadjutor appear to suppose, abandon
it altogether to the free use of the
tenant. He must of necessity make
conditions, because he still retains his
primary interest in the soil; and if
these were not made, the land would
in all probability be returned to him
after the expiry of the lease, utterly
unprofitable and exhausted, it being
the clear interest of the tenant to take
as much out of it as possible during
the currency of his occupation. Now
all these conditions are perfectly well
known to the competing farmer, and
if he is not inclined to assent to them,
he need not make an offer for the
land. Does Mr Bright mean to assert
that the competition for land is so
great, that the tenant-farmers are
absolutely offering more than the
subjects which they lease are worth?
If so, the most gullible person on the
face of this very gullible earth would
not believe him. To aver that any
body of men in this country, are wilfully
and avowedly carrying on a trade
or profession at a certain loss, is to
utter an absurdity so gross as to be
utterly unworth a refutation. And if
Mr Bright does not mean this, we
shall thank him to explain how the
competition for land is a practical
grievance to the farmer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we are far from maintaining
that the system of strict game
preservation is either wise or creditable,
and we shall state our arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
to the contrary hereafter. At present
let us proceed with Mr Welford.</p>

<p>About one-half, or even more, of
this volume, is occupied with evidence
to prove that the preservation of
game upon an estate is more or less
detrimental to the crops. Who denies
it? Pheasants, though they may feed
a great deal upon wild seeds and insects,
are unquestionably fond of corn&mdash;so
are partridges; and hares and
rabbits have too good taste to avoid
a field of clover or of turnips. And
shall this&mdash;says Mr Bright, having
recourse to a late rhetoric&mdash;shall this
be permitted in a Christian or a civilised
country? Are there not thousands
of poor to whom that grain,
wasted upon mere vermin, would be
precious? Are our aristocracy so selfish
as to prefer the encouragement of
brute animals to the lives of their fellow
men? &amp;c. &amp;c; to all of which
eloquent bursts the pious Mr Welford
subjoins his ditto and Amen.
For our own part, we can see no
reason why hares, and pheasants,
and partridges, should not be fed as
well as Quakers. While living they
are undoubtedly more graceful creatures,
when dead they are infinitely
more valuable. When removed from
this scene of transitory trouble, Mr
Bright, except in an Owhyhean market,
would fetch a less price than an
ordinary rabbit. Our taste may be
peculiar, but we would far rather see
half-a-dozen pretty leverets at play in
a pasture field of an evening, than as
many hulking members of the Anti-Corn-Law
League performing a ponderous
saraband. Vermin indeed!
Did Mr Bright ever see a Red-deer?
We shrewdly suspect not; and if,
peradventure, he were to fall in with
the monarch of the wilderness in the
rutting season, somewhere about the
back of Schehallion or the skirts of
the moor of Rannoch, there would be
a yell loud enough to startle the cattle
on a thousand hills, and a rapid
disparition of the drab-coloured integuments
into the bosom of a treacherous
peat-bog. But a Red-deer, too,
will eat corn, and often of a moonlight
night his antlers may be seen
waving in the crofts of the upland
tenant; therefore, according to Mr
Bright, he too is vermin, and must
be exterminated accordingly.</p>

<p>And this brings us to Mr Welford's
grand remedy, which is abundantly
apparent from the notes and commentaries
interspersed throughout the
volume. This gentleman, in the plenitude
of his consideration for the
well-being of his country, is deliberately
of opinion that game should be
exterminated altogether! Here is a
bloody-minded fellow for you with a
vengeance!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What! all my pretty chickens and their dam!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Did you say all?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What! shall not a single hare, or
pheasant, or partridge, or plover, or
even a solitary grouse, be spared from
the swoop of this destroying kite?
Not one. Richard Griffiths Welford,
Esquire, Barrister-at-law, has undertaken
to rouse the nation from its
deadly trance. Yet a few years, and
no more shall the crow of the gorcock
be heard on the purple heath, or
the belling of the deer in the forest,
or the call of the landrail in the field.
No longer shall we watch at evening
the roe gliding from the thicket, or
the hare dancing across the lawn.
They have committed a crime in a
free-tradeland&mdash;battened incontinently
upon corn and turnips&mdash;and, therefore,
they must all die! Grain, although
our ports are to be opened,
has now become a sacred thing, and
is henceforward to be dedicated to
the use of man alone. Therefore we
are not without apprehension that the
sparrows must die too, and the
thrushes and blackbirds&mdash;for they
make sad havoc in our dear utilitarian's
garden&mdash;and the larks, and the
rooks, and the pigeons. Voiceless
now must be our groves in the green
livery of spring. There shall be no
more chirping, or twittering, or philandering
among the branches&mdash;no
cooing or amorous dalliance, or pairing
on the once happy eve of St Valentine.
All the <i>fauna</i> of Britain&mdash;all
the melodists of the woods&mdash;must die!
In one vast pie must they be baked,
covered in with a monumental crust of
triumphant flour, through which their
little claws may appear supplicantly
peering upwards, as if to implore some
mercy for the surviving stragglers of
their race. But stragglers there cannot
be many. Timber, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
our patriotic Welford, is, "next to
game, the farmer's chief enemy!"
What miserable idiots our infatuated
ancestors must have been! They
thought that by planting they were
conferring a boon upon their country;
and in Scotland in particular they
strove most anxiously to redeem the
national reproach. But they were
utterly wrong: Welford has said it.
Timber is a nuisance&mdash;a sort of vegetable
vermin, we suppose&mdash;so down
must go Dodona and her oaks; and
the pride of the forests be laid for
ever low. Nothing in all broad England&mdash;and
we fear also with us&mdash;must
hereafter overtop the fields of wheat
except the hedgerows! Timber is
inimical to the farmer; therefore, free
be the winds to blow from the German
ocean to the Atlantic, without
encountering the resistance of
a single forest&mdash;no more tossing of
the branches or swaying of the stems&mdash;or
any thing save the steeples, fast
falling in an age of reason into decay,
the bulk of some monstrous workhouse,
as dingy and cheerless as a
prison, and the pert myriads of chimney-stalks
of the League belching
forth, in the face of heaven, their columns
of smoke and of pollution!
Happy England, when these things
shall come to pass, and not a tree or
a bush be left as a shelter for the
universal vermin! No&mdash;not quite
universal, for a respite will doubtless
be given to the persecuted races of
the badger, the hedgehog, the polecat,
the weasel, and the stoat. All these
are egg-eaters or game-consumers,
and so long as they keep to the hedgerows
and assist in the work of extermination,
they will not only be spared
but encouraged. Let them, however,
beware. So soon as the last egg of
the last English partridge is sucked,
and the last of the rabbits turned over
in convulsive throes, with the teeth of a
fierce little devil inextricably fastened
in its jugular&mdash;so soon as the rage of
hunger drives the present Pariahs of
the preserve to the hen-roost&mdash;human
forbearance is at an end, and their fate
also is sealed. The hen-harrier and
the sparrowhawk, so long as they
quarter the fields, pounce upon the
imprudent robin, or strike down the
lark while caroling upon the verge of
the cloud, will be considered in our
new state of society, as sacred animals
as the Ibis. But let them, after
having fulfilled their mission, deviate
from the integrity of their ways, and
come down upon a single ginger-pile,
peeping his dirty way over the shards
of a midden, towards his scrauching
and be-draggled mother&mdash;and the race
will be instantly proscribed. A few
years more, and, according to the
system of Messrs Bright and Welford,
not a single wild animal&mdash;could we
not also get rid of the insects?&mdash;will
be found within the confines of Great
Britain, except the gulls who live
principally upon fish; and possibly,
should there be a scarcity of herring,
it may be advisable to exterminate
them also.</p>

<p>Here is a pretty state of matters!
First, there is to be no more sporting.
That, of course, in the eyes of Messrs
Bright and Welford, who know as
much about shooting as they do of
trigonometry, is a very minor consideration;
but even there we take
leave to dissent. Gouty and frail
as we are, we have yet a strong natural
appetite for the moors, and we shall
wrestle to the last for our privilege
with the sturdiest broadbrim in Quakerdom.
Our boys shall be bred as we
were, with their foot upon the heather,
in the manliest and most exhilarating
of all pastimes; and that because
we wish to see them brought up as
Christians and gentlemen, not as
puzzle-pated sceptics or narrow-minded
utilitarian theorists. We desire
to see them attain their full development,
both of mind and body&mdash;to
acquire a kindly and a keen relish
for nature&mdash;to love their sovereign
and their country&mdash;to despise all
chicanery and deceit&mdash;and to know
and respect the high-minded peasantry
and poor of their native land.
We have no idea that they shall be
confined in their exercise or their sports
to the public highway. We do not
look upon this earth or island as made
solely to produce corn for the supply
of Mr Bright and his forced population.
We wish that the youth of our
country should be taught that God has
created other beings besides the master
and the mechanic&mdash;that the beasts
of the field and the fowls of the air
have a value in their Maker's eye,
and that man has a commisson to use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span>
them, but not to exterminate and
destroy. "My opinion is," says Mr
Bright, speaking with a slight disregard
to grammar, of the sporting propensities
of the landed gentry&mdash;"my
opinion is, that there are other pursuits
which it will better become them
to follow, and which it will be a thousand
times better for the country if
they turn their attention to them."
For Mr Bright's opinion, we have not
the smallest shadow of respect. We
can well believe that, personally, he
has not the slightest inclination to
participate in the sports of the field.
We cannot for a moment imagine
him in connexion with a hunting-field,
or toiling over moor or mountain
in pursuit of his game, or up to
his waist in a roaring river with a
twenty-pound salmon on his line,
making its direct way for the cataract.
In all and each of these situations we
are convinced that he would be utterly
misplaced. We can conceive him, and
no doubt he is, much at home in the
superintendence of the gloomy factory&mdash;in
the centre of a hecatomb of
pale human beings, who toil on day and
night in that close and stifling atmosphere,
as ceaselessly and almost as mechanically
as the wheels which drone
and whistle and clank above and
around them&mdash;in the midst of his
stores of calico, and cotton, and corduroy&mdash;in
the midnight councils of
the grasping League, or the front of
a degraded hustings. But from none
of these situations whatever, has he
any right to dictate to the gentlemen
of Britain what they should do, or
what they should leave undone. He
has neither an eye for nature, nor a
heart to participate in rural amusements.
And a very nice place an
English manor-house would be under
his peculiar superintendence and the
operation of the new regime! In the
morning we should meet, ladies and
gentlemen, in the breakfast-room,
all devoutly intent upon the active
demolition of the muffins. Tea and
coffee there are in abundance&mdash;but
not good, for the first has the
flavour of the hedges, and the second
reminds us villanously of Hunt's
roasted corn. There are eggs, however,
and on the sideboard rest a
large round of beef, with a thick margin
of rancid yellow fat, and a ham
which is literal hog's-lard. There are
no fish. The trouting stream has been
turned from its natural course to move
machinery, and now rolls to the
shrinking sea, not in native silver,
but in alternate currents of indigo,
ochre, or cochineal, according to the
hue most in request for the moment
at the neighbouring dye-work. In
vain you look about for grouse-pie,
cold partridge, snipe, or pheasant.
You might as well ask for a limb of
the ichthyosaurus as for a wing of
these perished animals. Deuce a creature
is there in the room except
bipeds, and they are all of the manufacturing
breed. You recollect the
days of old, when your entry into the
breakfast-room used to be affectionately
welcomed by terrier, setter, and spaniel,
and you wonder what has become
of these ancient inmates of the
family. On inquiry you are informed,
that&mdash;being non-productive animals,
and mere consumers of food which
ought to be reserved for the use of
man alone&mdash;they have one and all of
them been put to death: and your
host points rather complacently to
the effigy of old Ponto, who has been
stuffed by way of a specimen of an
extinct species, and who now glares
at you with glassy eyes from beneath
the shelter of the mahogany sideboard.
Tired of the conversation,
which is principally directed towards
the working of the new tariff, the last
improvement in printed calicoes, and
the prices of some kind of stock which
appears to fluctuate as unaccountably
as the barometer, you rise from table
and move towards the window in
hopes of a pleasant prospect. You
have it. The old park, which used to
contain some of the finest trees in
Britain&mdash;oaks of the Boscobel order,
and elms that were the boast of the
country&mdash;is now as bare as the palm
of your hand, and broken up into potato
allotments. The shrubbery and
flower parterres, with their elegant
terrace vases and light wire fences,
have disappeared. There is not a
bush beyond a few barberries, evidently
intended for detestable jam, nor
a flower, except some chamomiles,
which may be infused into a medicinal
beverage, and a dozen great
stringy coarse-looking rhubarbs,
enough to give you the dyspepsia, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span>
you merely imagine them in a tart.
At the bottom of the slope lies the
stream whereof we have spoken already,
not sinuous or fringed with
alders as of yore; but straight as an
arrow, and fashioned into the semblance
of a canal. It is spanned on
the part which is directly in front of
the windows, by a bridge on the skew
principle, the property of a railway
company; and at the moment you are
gazing on the landscape in a sort
of admiring trance, an enormous train
of coal and coke waggons comes rushing
by, and a great blast of smoke
and steam rolling past the house,
obscures for a moment the utilitarian
beauty of the scene. That dissipated,
you observe on the other side of the
canal several staring red brick buildings,
with huge chimney-stalks stinking
in the fresh, frosty morning air.
These are the factories of your host,
the source of his enviable wealth;
and yonder dirty village which you
see about half a mile to the right,
with its squab Unitarian lecture room,
is the abode of his honest artisans.
Nevertheless, you see nobody
stirring about. How should you?
The whole population is comfortably
housed, for the next twelve hours at
least, within brick, and assisting the
machinery to do its work. No idleness
now in England. Had you, indeed,
risen about five or six in the morning,
when the clatter of a sullen bell roused
you from your dreams of Jemima,
you might have seen some scores of
lanterns meandering like glow-worms
along the miry road which leads from
the village to the factories, until absorbed
within their early jaws. That
is the appointed time for the daily
emigration, and until all the taskwork
is done, no straggling whatever is
permitted. The furthest object in
view is a parallelogram Bastile on the
summit of a hill, once wooded to the
top, and well known to the rustics as
the place where the fullest nuts and
the richest May-flowers might be
gathered, but now in turnips, and you
are told that the edifice is the Union
Workhouse.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, you begin to consider
how you shall fill up the dreary
vacuum which still yawns between
you and dinner. Of course you cannot
shoot, unless you are inclined to
take a day at the ducks and geese,
which would be rather an expensive
amusement. You covet a ride, and
propose a scamper across the country.
Our dear sir, it is as much as your life
is worth! What with canals and viaducts,
and railways and hedgerows,
you could not get over a mile without
either being plunged into water, or
knocked down by tow ropes, or run
into by locomotives, or pitched from
embankments, or impaled alive, or slain
by a stroke of electricity from some
telegraphic conductor! Recollect that
we are not now living in the days
of steeple-chasing. Then as to horses,
are you not aware that our host keeps
only two&mdash;and fine sleek, sturdy Flanders
brutes they are&mdash;for the purpose
of conveying Mrs Bobbins and her
progeny to the meeting-house? There
is no earthly occasion for any more
expensive stud. The railway station
is just a quarter of a mile from the
door, and Eclipse himself could never
match our new locomotives for speed.
But you may have a drive if you
please, and welcome. Where shall we
go to? There used to be a fine waterfall
at an easy distance, with rocks,
and turf, and wildflowers, and all that
sort of thing; and though the season
is a little advanced, we might still
make shift under the hazels and the
hollies; could we not invite the ladies
to accompany us, and extemporise a
pic-nic? Our excellent friend! that
waterfall exists no longer. It was a
mere useless waste; has been blown
up with gun-cotton; and the glen below
it turned into a reservoir for the
supply of a manufacturing town. The
hazels are all down, and the hollies
pounded into birdlime. And that fine
old baronial residence, where there
were such exquisite Claudes and
Ruysdaels? Oh! that estate was
bought by Mr Smalt the eminent
dyer, from the trustees of the late
Lord&mdash;the old mansion has been
pulled down, a cottage <i>ornée</i> built in
its place, and the pictures were long
ago transferred to the National Gallery.
And is there nothing at all
worth seeing in the county? Oh yes!
There is Tweel's new process for making
silk out of sow's ears, and Bottomson's
clothing mills, where you
see raw wool put into one end of the
machinery, and issue from the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
in the shape of ready-made breeches.
Then a Socialist lecture on the sin
and consequences of matrimony will
be delivered in the market-town at
two o'clock precisely, by Miss Lewdlaw&mdash;quite
a lady, I assure you&mdash;whom
you will afterwards meet at
dinner. Or you may, if you please,
attend the meeting of the Society for
the Propagation of a Natural Religion,
at which the Rev. Mr Scampson
will preside; or you may go down to
the factories, or any where else you
please, except the village, for there is
a great deal of typhus fever in it, and
we are a little apprehensive for the
children! You decline these tempting
offers, and resolve to spend the morning
in the house. Is there a billiard
room? How can you possibly suppose
it? Time, sir, is money; and
money is not to be made by knocking
about ivory balls. But there is the
library if you should like to study,
and plenty material within it. Delighted
at the prospect of passing
some congenial though solitary hours,
you enter the apartment, and, disregarding
the models upon the table,
which are intended to elucidate the
silk and sow's-ear process, you ransack
the book-shelves for some of your
ancient favourites. But in vain you
will search either for Shakspeare or
Scott, Milton or Fielding, Jeremy
Taylor or Blackwood's Edinburgh
Magazine: all these are proscribed
antiquities. Instead of these you will
find Essays by Hampden, junior, and
Ethics by Thistlewood, senior, Paine's
Age of Reason, Jeremy Bentham's
Treatises, Infanticide Vindicated, by
Herod Virginius Cackell, Esq., Member
of the Literary Institute of Owenstown,
Cobden's Speeches, Wheal's
Exposition of the Billy-roller, Grubb's
Practical Deist, Welford's Influences
of the Game Laws, and much more
such profitable reading. What would
you not give for a volume by Willison
Glass! Disgusted with this literary
miscellany, you chuck the Practical
Deist into the fire, and walk up-stairs
to rejoin the ladies. You find them
in the drawing-room hard at work
upon cross-stitch and pincushions for
the great Bazar which is shortly to
be opened under the auspices of the
Anti-Christian League, and you feel
for a moment like an intruder. But
Emily Bobbins, a nice girl, who will
have thirty thousand pounds when
her venerated sire is conveyed to
the Mausoleum of the Bobbinses,
and who has at this present moment
a very pretty face, trips up and
asks you for a contribution to her
yearly album. Yearly?&mdash;the phrase
is an odd one, and you crave explanation.
The blooming virgin informs you
that she edits an annual volume, popular
in certain circles, for the Society
for the Abolition of all Criminal
Punishment, she being a corresponding
Member; and she presents you with
last year's compilation. You open
the work, and find some literary <i>bijouterie</i>
by the disciples of the earnest
school, poems on the go-a-head principle,
and tales under such captivating
titles as the Virtuous Poacher,
Theresa, or the Heroine of the Workhouse,
and Walter Truck, an Easy
Way with the Mechanic. There are
also sundry political fragments by
the deep-thinkers of the age, from
which you discover that Regicide is
the simplest cure for "Flunkeyism,
Baseness, and Unveracity," and that
the soundest philosophers of the
world are two gentlemen, rejoicing
in the exotic names of Sauerteig and
Teufelsdröckh. You, being a believer
in the Book of Common Prayer, decline
to add your contribution to the
Miscellany, and make the best of
your way from the house for a stroll
upon the public highway. For some
hours you meander through the mud,
between rows of stiff hedges; not a
stage-coach, nor even a buggy is to
be seen. You sigh for the old green
lanes and shady places which have
now disappeared for ever, and you
begin to doubt whether, after all, regenerated
England is the happiest
country of the universe. It appears
an absolute desert. At a turn of a
road you come in sight of a solitary
venerable crow&mdash;the sole surviving
specimen of his race still extant in
the county&mdash;whose life is rendered
bitter by a system of unceasing persecution.
He mistakes you for Mr
Richard Griffiths Welford, and, with
a caw of terror, takes flight across
a Zahara of Swedish turnips. On
your way home you meet with three
miserable children who are picking
the few unwithered leaves from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span>
hedges. You cross-question them,
and ascertain that they receive a
salary of twopence a-day from the
owner of the truck-shop at the factory,
in return for their botanical collections.
You think of China, with a
strong conviction of the propriety of
becoming a Mandarin.</p>

<p>At dinner you are seated betwixt
Miss Lewdlaw and the Rev. Mr
Scampson. The appearance of the
lady convinces you that she has excellent
reasons for her deep-rooted
hatred of matrimony&mdash;for what serpent
(in his senses) would have tempted
that dropsical Eve? The gentleman
is a bold, sensual-lipped, pimply
individual, attired in a rusty suit
of black, the very picture of a brutal
Boanerges. He snorts during his
repast, clutches with his huge red
fingers, whereof the nails are absolute
ebony, at every dish within his reach,
and is constantly shouting for a dram.
The dinner is a plentiful one, but ill-cooked
and worse served; and the
wines are simply execrable. Very
drearily lags the time until the ladies
rise to retire, a movement which is
greeted by Mr Scampson with a coarse
joke and a vulgar chuckle. Then begin
the sweets of the evening. Old
Bobbins draws your especial attention
to his curious old free-trade port,
at eighteen shillings the dozen; and
very curious, upon practical examination,
you will find it. After three
glasses, you begin to suspect that you
have swallowed a live crab unawares,
and you gladly second Mr Scampson
in his motion for something hot. The
conversation then becomes political,
and, to a certain extent, religious.
Bobbins, who has a brother in Parliament,
is vehement in his support of
the Twenty Hours' Labour Bill, and
insists upon the necessity of a measure
for effectually coercing apprentices.
Bugsley, his opposite neighbour,
can talk of nothing but stock
and yarn. But Scampson, in right of
his calling, takes the lion's share of
the conversation. He denounces the
Church, not yet dis-established&mdash;hopes
to see the day when every Bishop
upon the Bench shall be brought to
the block&mdash;and stigmatises the Universities
as the nests of bigotry and
intolerance. With many oaths, he
declares his conviction that Robespierre
was a sensible fellow&mdash;and as
he waxes more furious over each
successive tumbler, you wisely think
that there may be some danger
in contradicting so virulent a champion,
and steal from the room at
the first convenient opportunity. In
the drawing-room you find Miss
Lewdlaw descanting upon her favourite
theories. She is expounding
to Emily Bobbins her rights as a
socialist and a woman, and illustrating
her lecture by some quotations
from the works of Aurora Dudevant.
The sweet girl, evidently under the
magnetic influence of her preceptress,
regards you with a humid eye and
flushed cheek as you enter; but having
no fancy to approach the charmed
circle of the Lewdlaw, you keep at
the other end of the room, and amuse
yourself with an illustrated copy of
Jack Sheppard. In a short time,
Bobbins, Bugsley, and Scampson, the
last partially inebriated, make their
appearance; and an animated erotic
dialogue ensues between the gentleman
in dubious orders, and the disciple
of Mary Wolstonecraft. You
begin to feel uncomfortable, and as
Bugsley is now snoring, and Bobbins
attempting to convince his helpmate
of the propriety of more brandy and
water, you desert the drawing-room,
bolt up-stairs, pack your portmanteau,
and go to bed with a firm resolution
to start next morning by the earliest
train; and as soon as possible to ascertain
whether Jemima will consent
to accompany you to Canada or Australia,
or some other uncivilised part
of the world where trees grow, waters
run, and animals exist as nature has
decreed, and where the creed of the
socialist and jargon of the factory
are fortunately detested or unknown.</p>

<p>Such, gentle reader, is the England
which the patriots of the Bright school
are desirous to behold; and such it
may become if we meekly and basely
yield to revolutionary innovations,
and conciliate every demagogue by
adopting his favourite nostrum. We
have certainly been digressing a good
deal further than is our wont; but we
trust you will not altogether disapprove
of our expedition to the new
Utopia. We hope that your present,
and a great many future Christmasses
may be spent more pleasantly; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
that, in your day at least, peace may
never be effected at the expense of a
virtual solitude. Let us now consider
what alterations may properly
and humanely be made upon the present
existing Game laws.</p>

<p>On the whole, we are inclined to
agree with the resolutions adopted by
the committee. These appear to recognise
the principle of a qualified
right of property in game, and that
this property is now vested in the
<i>occupier</i> of the soil. By this rule
which may if necessary be declared
by enactment, the tenant has at all
times the power to secure the game
to himself, unless he chooses to part
with that right by special bargain. It
is of course inconsistent with this
qualified right of property, that any
person should kill game upon lands
which he is not privileged to enter;
and the committee are therefore of
opinion, that the violation of that
right should still continue to be visited
with legal penalties. But they
think&mdash;and in this we most cordially
agree with them&mdash;that considerable
alteration should be made in the present
penal code, and that, in particular,
cumulative penalties for poaching
should be abolished. It is monstrous
that such penalties, to which the
poorer classes in this country are
most peculiarly liable, should be any
longer allowed to exist, while the
offence which these are intended to
punish is in every proper sense a
single one. We are inclined to get
rid of every difficulty on this head by
an immediate discontinuance of the
certificates. The amount of revenue
drawn from these is really insignificant,
and in many cases it must stand
in the way of a fair exercise of his
privilege by the humbler occupant of
the soil. If a poor upland crofter, who
rents an acre or two from a humane
landlord, and who has laid out part
of it in a garden, should chance to
see, of a clear frosty night, a hare
insinuate herself through the fence,
and demolish his winter greens&mdash;it is
absolute tyranny to maintain, that he
may not reach down the old rusty
fowling-piece from the chimney, take
a steady vizzy at puss, and tumble
her over in the very act of her delinquency,
without having previously
paid over for the use of her gracious
Majesty some four pounds odds; or
otherwise to be liable in a penalty of
twenty pounds, with the pleasant
alternative of six months' imprisonment!
In such a case as this the man
is not sporting; he is merely protecting
his own, is fairly entitled to convert
his enemy into wholesome soup,
and should be allowed to do so with a
conscience void of offence towards
God or man. We must have no
state restrictions or qualifications to
a right of property which may be enjoyed
by the smallest cotter, and no
protective laws to debar him from the
exercise of his principle. And therefore
it is that we advocate the immediate
abolition of the certificate.</p>

<p>What the remaining penalty should
be is matter for serious consideration.
It appears evident that the common
law of redress is not sufficient. Game
is at best but a qualified property; for
your interest in it ceases the moment
that it leaves your land; but still you
<i>have</i> an interest, may be a considerable
pecuniary loser by its infringement,
and therefore you are entitled
to demand an adequate protection.
But then it is hardly possible, when
we consider what human nature with
all its powerful instincts is, to look
upon poaching in precisely the same
light with theft. By no process of
mental ratiocination can you make a
sheep out of a hare. You did not
buy the creature, it is doubtful
whether you bred it, and in five
minutes more it may be your neighbour's
property, and that of its own
accord. You cannot even reclaim it,
though born in your private hutch.
Now this is obviously a very slippery
kind of property; and the poor man&mdash;who
knows these facts quite as well
as the rich, and who is moreover
cursed with a craving stomach, a
large family, and a strong appetite
for roast&mdash;is by no means to be considered,
morally or equitably, in the
same light with the ruffian who commits
a burglary for the sake of your
money, or carries away your sheep
from the fold. It ought to be, if it is
not, a principle in British law, that the
temptation should be considered before
adjudging upon the particular offence.
The schoolboy&mdash;whose natural
propensity for fruit has been roused
by the sight of some far too tempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
pippins, and who, in consequence,
has undertaken the hazard of a midnight
foray&mdash;is, if detected in the act,
subjected to no further penalty than
a pecuniary mulct or a thrashing, especially
if his parents belong to the more
respectable classes of society. And
yet this is a theft as decided and more
inexcusable, than if the nameless
progeny of a vagrant should, hunger-urged,
filch a turnip or two from
a field, and be pounced upon by some
heartless farmer, who considers that
he is discharging every heavenly and
earthly duty if he pays his rent and
taxes with unscrupulous punctuality.
It is a crying injustice that any
trifling piccadillo on the part of the
poor or their children, should be treated
with greater severity than is used in
the case of the rich. This is neither
an equitable nor a Christian rule. We
have no right to subject the lowest of
the human family to a contamination
from which we would shrink to expose
the highest; and the true sense of
justice and of charity, which, after
all, we believe to be deeply implanted
in the British heart, will, we trust,
before long, spare us the continual
repetition of class Pariahs of infant
years brought forward in small courts
of justice for no other apparent reason
than to prove, that our laws care more
leniently for the rich than they do for
the offspring of the poor.</p>

<p>While, therefore, we consider it just
that game should be protected otherwise
than by the law of trespass, we
would not have the penalty made, in
isolated cases, a harsh one. A trespass
in pursuit of game should, we think,
be punished in the first instance by a
fine, not so high as to leave the
labourer no other alternative than the
jail, or so low as to make the payment
of it a matter of no importance. Let
Giles, who has intromitted with a
pheasant, be mulcted in a week's
wages, and let him, at the same time,
distinctly understand the nature and
the end of the career in which he has
made the incipient step. Show him
that an offence, however venial, becomes
materially aggravated by repetition;
for it then assumes the character
of a daring and wilful defiance of
the laws of the realm. For the second
of offence mulct him still, but higher, and
let the warning be more solemnly
repeated. These penalties might be inflicted
by a single justice of the peace.
But if Giles offends a third time, his
case becomes far more serious, and he
should be remitted to a higher tribunal.
It is now almost clear that he has become
a confirmed poacher, and determined
breaker of the laws&mdash;it is more than
likely that money is his object. Leniency
has been tried without success,
and it is now necessary to show him that
the law will not be braved with impunity.
Three months' imprisonment,
with hard labour, should be inflicted
for the purpose of reclaiming him; and
if, after emerging from prison, he
should again offend, let him forthwith
be removed from the country.</p>

<p>Some squeamish people may object
to our last proposal as severe. We
do not think it so. The original
nature of the offence has become
entirely changed; for it must be
allowed on all hands, that habitual
breach of the laws is a very different
thing from a casual effraction. It
would be cruelty to transport an
urchin for the first handkerchief he
has stolen; but after his fourth
offence, that punishment becomes an
actual mercy. Nor should the moral
effect produced by the residence of
a determined poacher in any neighbourhood
be overlooked. A poacher
can rarely carry on his illicit trade
without assistance: he entices boys
by offering them a share in his gains,
introduces them to the beer and the
gin shop, and thus they are corrupted
for life. It is sheer nonsense to say
that poaching does not lead to other
crimes. It leads in the first instance
to idleness, which we know to be the
parent of all crime; and it rapidly
wears away all finer sense of the
distinction between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>.
From poacher the transition to smuggler
is rapid and easy, and your smuggler
is usually a desperado. With all
deference to Mr Welford, his conclusion,
that poaching should be prevented
by the entire extermination of
game, is a most pitiable instance of
calm imperturbable imbecility. He
might just as well say that the only
means of preventing theft is the total
destruction of property, and the true
remedy for murder the annihilation
of the human race.</p>

<p>We agree also with the committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
that some distinction must be made
between cases of simple poaching,
and those which are perpetrated by
armed and daring gangs. To these
banditti almost every instance of assault
and murder connected with
poaching is traceable, and the sooner
such fellows are shipped off to hunt
kangaroos in Australia the better.
But we think that such penalties as
we have indicated above, would in
most cases act as a practical detention
from this offence, and would certainly
remove all ground for complaint
against the unnecessary severity of
the law.</p>

<p>With regard to the destruction of
crops by game, especially when caused
by the preserves of a neighbouring
proprietor, the committee seems to
have been rather at a loss to deal.
And there is certainly a good deal of
difficulty in the matter. For on the
one hand, the game, while committing
the depredation, is clearly not the
property of the preserver, and may
of course be killed by the party to
whose ground it passes: on the other
hand, it usually returns to the preserve
after all the damage has been done.
This seems to be one of the few instances
in which the law can afford no
remedy. The neighbouring farmer may
indeed either shoot in person, or let
the right of shooting to another; and
in most cases he has the power to do
so&mdash;for if his own landlord is also a
preserver, it is not likely that the
damage will be aggravated&mdash;and he
has taken his farm in the full knowledge
of the consequences of game preservation.
Still there must always
remain an evil, however partial, and
this leads us to address a few words
to the general body of the game-preservers.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, some of you are not altogether
without fault in this matter.
You have given a handle to accusations,
which your enemies&mdash;and they
are the enemies also of the true
interests of the country&mdash;have been
eager and zealous in using. You
have pushed your privileges too far,
and, if you do not take care, you will
raise a storm which it may be very
difficult to allay. What, in the name
of common sense, is the use of this
excessive preserving? You are not
blamed, nor are you blamable, for
reserving the right of sporting in your
own properties to yourselves; but why
make your game such utterly sacred
animals? Why encourage their over-increase
to such a degree as must naturally
injure yourselves by curtailing
your rent; and which, undoubtedly,
whatever be his bargain, must irritate
the farmer, and lessen that harmony
and good-will which ought to exist betwixt
you both? Is it for sport you do
these things? If so, your definition
of sport must be naturally different
from ours. The natural instinct of
the hunter, which is implanted in the
heart of man, is in some respects
a noble one. He does not, even
in a savage state, pursue his game,
like a wild beast of prey, merely for
the sake of his appetite&mdash;he has a joy
in the strong excitement and varied
incidents of the chase. The wild
Indian and the Norman disciple of St
Hubert, alike considered it a science;
and so it is even now to us who follow
our pastime upon the mountains, and
who must learn to be as wary and alert
as the creatures which we seek to kill.
The mere skill of the marksman has
little to do with the real enjoyment of
sport. That may be as well exhibited
upon a target as upon a living
object, and surely there is no pleasure
at all in the mere wanton destruction
of life. The true sportsman takes
delight in the sagacity and steadiness
of his dogs&mdash;in seeking for the different
wild animals each in its peculiar
haunt&mdash;and his relish is all the keener
for the difficulty and uncertainty of
his pursuit. Such at least is our idea
of sport, and we should know something
about it, having carried a gun
almost as long as we can remember.
But it is possible we may be getting
antiquated in our notions. Two
months ago we took occasion to make
some remarks upon the modern
murders on the moors, and we are
glad to observe that our humane
doctrine has been received with almost
general acquiescence. We must
now look to the doings at the Manor
House, at which, Heaven be praised,
we never have assisted; but the bruit
thereof has gone abroad, and we believe
the tidings to be true.</p>

<p>We have heard of game preserved
over many thousands of acres, not
waste, but yellow corn-land, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
many an intervening belt of noble
wood and copse, until the ground
seems actually alive with the number
of its animal occupants. The large,
squat, sleek hares lie couched in every
furrow; each thistle-tuft has its lurking
rabbit; and ceaseless at evening
is the crow of the purple-necked
pheasant from the gorse. The crops
ripen, and are gathered in, not so
plentifully as the richness of the land
would warrant, but still strong and
heavy. The partridges are now seen
running in the stubble-fields, or sunning
themselves on some pleasant
bank, so secure that they hardly will
take the trouble to fly away as you
approach, but generally slip through
a hedge, and lie down upon the other
side. And no wonder; for not only
has no gun been fired over the whole
extensive domain, though the autumn
is now well advanced; but a cordon
of gamekeepers extends along the
whole skirts of the estate, and neither
lurcher nor poacher can manage to
effect an entrance. Within ten minutes
after they had set foot within
the guarded territory, the first would
be sprawling upon his back in the
agonies of death, and the second on
his way to the nearest justice of peace,
with two pairs of knuckles uncomfortably
lodged within the innermost folds
of his neckcloth. The proprietor, a
middle-aged gentleman of sedentary
habits, does not, in all probability,
care much about sporting. If he does,
he rents a moor in Scotland, where he
amuses himself until well on in October,
and then feels less disposed for a
tamer and a heavier sport. But in
November he expects, after his ancient
hospitable fashion, to have a select
party at the manor-house, and he is
desirous of affording them amusement.
They arrive, to the number, perhaps,
of a dozen males, some of then persons
of an elevated rank, or of high
political connexion. There is considerable
commotion on the estate.
The staff of upper and under keepers
assemble with a large train of beaters
before the baronial gateway. They
bring with them neither pointers nor
setters&mdash;these old companions of the
sportsman are useless in a battue;
but there are some retrievers in the
leash, and a few well-broken spaniels.
It is quite a scene for Landseer&mdash;that
antique portico, with the group before
it, and the gay and sloping uplands
illuminated by a clear winter's sun.
The guests sally forth, all mirth
and spirits, and the whole party proceed
to an appointed cover. Then
begins the massacre. There is a
shouting and rustling of beaters: at
every step the gorgeous pheasant
whirs from the bush, or the partridge
glances slopingly through the trees,
or the woodcock wings his way on
scared and noiseless pinion. Rabbits
by the hundred are scudding distractedly
from one pile of brushwood
to another. Loud cries of "Mark!" are
heard on every side, and at each shout
there is the explosion of a fowling-piece.
No time now to stop and load.
The keeper behind you is always ready
with a spare gun. How he manages
to cram in the powder and shot so
quickly is an absolute matter of marvel;
for you let fly at every thing, and
have lost all regard to the ordinary
calculations of distance. You had
better take care of yourself, however,
for you are getting into a thicket, and
neither Sir Robert, who is on your
right, nor the Marquis, who is your
left-hand neighbour, are remarkable
for extra caution, and the Baronet,
in particular, is short-sighted. We
don't quite like the appearance of that
hare which is doubling back. You had
better try to stop her before she reaches
that vista in the wood. Bang!&mdash;you
miss, and, at the same moment, a
charge of number five, from the weapon
of the Vavasour, takes effect
upon the corduroys of your thigh,
and, though the wound is but skin-deep,
makes you dance an extempore
fandango.</p>

<p>And so you go on from cover
to cover, for five successive hours,
through this rural poultry-yard, slaying,
and, what is worse, wounding
without slaying, beyond all ordinary
calculation. You have had a good
day's amusement, have you? Our
dear sir, in the estimation of any
sensible man or thorough sportsman,
you might as well have been amusing
yourself with a ride in the heart of
Falkirk Tryst, or assisting at one of
those German Jagds, where the deer
are driven into inclosures, and shot
down to the music of lute, harp,
cymbal, dulcimer, sackbut, and psaltery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
In fact, between ourselves, it
is not a thing to boast of, and the
amusement is, to say the least of it,
an expensive one. For the sake of
giving you, and the Marquis, and Sir
Robert, and a few more, two or three
days' sport, your host has sacrificed a
great part of the legitimate rental of
his estate&mdash;has maintained, from one
end of the year to the other, all those
personages in fustian and moleskin&mdash;and
has, moreover, made his tenantry
sulky. Do you think the price paid
is in any way compensated by the
value received? Of course not. You
are a man of sense, and therefore,
for the future, we trust that you will
set your face decidedly against the
battue system: shoot yourself, as a
gentleman ought to do&mdash;or, if you do
not care about it, give permission to
your own tenantry to do so. Rely
upon it, they will not abuse the
privilege.</p>

<p>The fact is, there never should be
more than two coveys in one field, or
half-a-dozen hares in each moderate
slip of plantation. That, believe us,
with the accession you will derive from
your neighbours, is quite sufficient
to keep you in exercise during the
season, and to supply your table with
game. No tenant whatever will object
to find food for such a stock. If
you want more exciting sport, come
north next August, and we shall take
you to a moor which is preserved by
a single shepherd's herd, where you
may kill your twenty brace a-day for
a month, and have a chance of a red-deer
into the bargain. But, if you
will not leave the south, do not, we
beseech you, turn yourself into a hen-wife,
and become ridiculous as a
hatcher of pheasants' eggs. The thing,
we are told, has been done by gentlemen
of small property, for the purpose
of getting up an appearance of
game: it would be quite as sane a
proceeding to improve the beauty of a
prospect by erecting cast-iron trees.
Above all things, whatever you do,
remember that you are the denizen of
a free country, where individual rights,
however sacred in themselves, must
not be extended to the injury of those
around you.</p>

<p>To say the truth, we have observed
with great pain, that a far too exclusive
spirit has of late manifested itself
in certain high places, and among persons
whom we regard too much to be
wholly indifferent to their conduct.
This very summer the public press has
been indignant in its denunciation of
the Dukes of Atholl and Leeds&mdash;the one
having, as it is alleged, attempted to
shut up a servitude road through Glen
Tilt, and the other established a cordon
for many miles around the skirts
of Ben-na-Mac-Dhui, our highest
Scottish mountain. We are not fully
acquainted with the particulars; but
from what we have heard, it would
appear that this wholesale exclusion
from a vast tract of territory is intended
to secure the solitude of two
deer-forests. Now, we are not going
to argue the matter upon legal
grounds&mdash;although, knowing something
of law, we have a shrewd suspicion
that both noble lords are in
utter misconception of their rights,
and are usurping a sovereignty which
is not to be found in their charters,
and which was never claimed or
exercised even by the Scottish Kings.
But the churlishness of the step is
undeniable, and we cannot but hope
that it has proceeded far more on
thoughtlessness than from intention.
The day has been, when any clansman,
or even any stranger, might
have taken a deer from the forest,
tree from the hill, or a salmon from
the river, without leave asked or
obtained: and though that state of
society has long since passed away,
we never till now have heard that the
free air of the mountains, and their
heather ranges, are not open to him
who seeks them. Is it indeed come
to this, that in bonny Scotland, the
tourist, the botanist, or the painter,
are to be debarred from visiting the
loveliest spots which nature ever
planted in the heart of a wilderness,
on pretence that they disturb the
deer! In a few years we suppose Ben
Lomond will be preserved, and the
summit of Ben Nevis remain as unvisited
by the foot of the traveller
as the icy peak of the Jungfrau. Not
so, assuredly, would have acted the
race of Tullibardine of yore. Royal
were their hunting gatherings, and
magnificent the driving of the Tinchel;
but over all their large territory
of Atholl, the stranger might have
wandered unquestioned, except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[772]</a></span>
know if he required hospitality. It is
not now the gate which is shut, but
the moor; and that not against the
depredator, but against the peaceful
wayfaring man. Nor can we as
sportsmen admit even the relevancy
of the reasons which have been assigned
for this wholesale exclusion. We
are convinced, that in each season
not above thirty or forty tourists
essay the ascent of Ben-na-Mac-Dhui,
and of that number, in all probability,
not one has either met or startled a
red deer. Very few men would venture
to strike out a devious path for
themselves over the mountains near
Loch Aven, which, in fact, constitute
the wildest district of the island. The
Quaker tragedy of Helvellyn might
easily be re-enacted amidst the dreary
solitudes of Cairn Gorm, and months
elapse before your friends are put in
possession of some questionable bones.
Nothing but enthusiasm will carry a
man through the intricacies of Glen
Lui, the property of Lord Fife, to
whom it was granted at no very distant
period of time out of the forfeited
Mar estates, and which is presently
rented by the Duke of Leeds; and
nothing more absurd can be supposed,
than that the entry of a single wanderer
into that immense domain, can
have the effect of scaring the deer
from the limits of so large a range.
This is an absurd and an empty excuse,
as every deer-stalker must know.
A stag is not so easily frightened, nor
will he fly the country from terror
at the apparition of the Cockney.
Depend upon it, the latter will be a
good deal the more startled of the two.
With open mouth and large gooseberry
eyes, he will stand gazing upon
the vision of the Antlered Monarch;
the sketch-book and pencil-case drop
from his tremulous hands, and he
stands aghast in apprehension of a
charge of horning, against which he
has no defence save a cane camp-stool,
folded up into the semblance of
a yellow walking-stick. Not so the
Red-deer. For a few moments he will
regard the Doudney-clad wanderer
of the wilds, not in fear but in surprise;
and then, snuffing the air which
conveys to his nostrils an unaccustomed
flavour of bergamot and lavender,
he will trot away over the
shoulder of the hill, move further up
the nearest corrie, and in a quarter of
an hour will be lying down amidst
his hinds in the thick brackens that
border the course of the lonely burn.</p>

<p>We could say a great deal more
upon this subject; but we hope that
expansion is unnecessary. Throughout
all Europe the right of passage
over waste and uncultivated land,
where there never were and never
can be inclosures, appears to be
universally conceded. What would
his Grace of Leeds say, if he were
told that the Bernese Alps were shut
up, and the liberty of crossing them
denied, because some Swiss seigneur
had taken it into his head to establish
a chamois preserve? The idea of
preserving deer in the way now attempted
is completely modern, and
we hope will be immediately abandoned.
It must not, for the sake of
our country, be said, that in Scotland,
not only the inclosures, but the wilds
and the mountains are shut out from
the foot of man; and that, where no
highway exists, he is debarred from
the privilege of the heather. Whatever
may be the abstract legal
rights of the aristocracy, we protest
against the policy and propriety of a
system which would leave Ben
Cruachan to the eagles, and render
Loch Ericht and Loch Aven as inaccessible
as those mighty lakes
which are said to exist in Central
Africa, somewhere about the sources
of the Niger.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Mr Kohl fixes the date of the "melted lead" day at 1319, forgetting that
Margaret, the Semiramis of the North, in whose reign the event occurred, did not
reign in Denmark until about 1375. She died in 1412.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In the year 1660, the different estates of Denmark made a voluntary surrender
of their rights into the hands of their sovereign, who became by that act
<i>absolute</i>: it is a fact unparalleled in the history of any other country. Up to the
year 1834, this unlimited power was exercised by the kings, who, it must be said
to their honour, never abused it by seeking to oppress or enslave their subjects.
In the year 1834, however, Frederic VI., of his own free will and choice, established
a representative government. The gift was by no means conferred in
consequence of any discontent exhibited under the hitherto restrictive system.
The intentions of the monarch were highly praiseworthy; their wisdom is not so
clear, as, under the new law, the kingdom is divided into four parts&mdash;1. The
Islands; 2. Sleswig; 3. Jutland; 4. Holstein; each having its own provincial
assembly. The number of representatives for the whole country amounts to 1217.
Each representative receives four rix-dollars a-day (a rix-dollar is 2s. 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d.) for
his services, besides his travelling expenses. The communication between the
sovereign and the assembly is through a royal commissioner, who is allowed to
vote, but not to speak.&mdash;See <i>Wheaton's History of Scandinavia</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Whilst in this neighbourhood, Mr Kohl should have explored the Gunderler
Wood, where stone circles and earth mounds are yet carefully preserved, marking
the site of one of the principal places of sacrifice in heathen times. At <i>Gysselfelt</i>,
a lay nunnery exists, founded as recently as the year 1799.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It was by the Duchess of Newcastle, according to Pepys, that this play was
written. In his Diary he says, under date of the 11th April 1667:&mdash;"To
Whitehall, thinking there to have seen the Duchess of Newcastle coming this
night to court to make a visit to the Queen. The whole story of this lady is a
romance, and all she does is romantic. Her footmen in velvet coats, and herself
in an antique dress, as they say; and was the other day at her own play, <i>The</i>
<i>Humorous Lovers</i>, the most ridiculous thing that ever was wrote, but yet she and
her lord mightily pleased with it; and she at the end made her respects to the
players from her box, and did give them thanks." This was the eccentric dame
who kept a maid of honour sitting up all night, to write down any bright idea or
happy inspiration by which she might be visited.</p></div>

and I do not altogether despair but that, from the success of this campaign,
we may hear of some advances made towards that which we so much desire. And
I shall esteem it much the happiest part of my life, if I can be instrumental in
putting a good end to the war, which grows so burdensome to our country, as well
as to our allies."&mdash;<i>Marlborough to Lord Oxford</i>, Aug. 20, 1711; Coxe, vi. 92.</p></div>
